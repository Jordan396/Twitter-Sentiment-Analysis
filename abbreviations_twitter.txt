@virginamerica i miss the #nerdbird in san jose
@virginamerica love it taking @southwestair on in their backyard! consumers win when business competes.
@virginamerica ​ is flying from love to austin now. that is most excellent news.
@virginamerica can we make every vx plane with #nerdbird? why should austin be the only one getting nerd love?
@virginamerica please add more frequency to pdx portland
@virginamerica congrats vx on the new route! ✈️🎉
@virginamerica i tried that. you offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until thurs. first time last time.
@virginamerica @americanair can you help with flights to get a 2y old battling cancer who needs treatment in 🇺🇸 @freyabevan_fund 💗 🎀 💗
@virginamerica never had a bad experience before but this one took the cake. now extortion for carry on items as well?
@virginamerica had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since i could not carry them on plane or lock bag.
@virginamerica all of group e was told there was no more room in the bins. when i got on the plane was room for at least 4 bags in my row!
@virginamerica thanks for making my flight from los angeles to jfk a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
@virginamerica i have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! i have been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
@virginamerica i am all about the in flight artisanal cheese and wine pairing.
@virginamerica does virgin america fly direct from seattle to new york city or boston?
@virginamerica that's classy.
@virginamerica i am sure a lot of your 747 and 777 jfk-lhr flights go a lot faster than 513mph with a strong tailwind.
@virginamerica now it is just t-minus 32 minutes until my elevate a silver upgrade window opens . #freeneversucks 😃👍
@virginamerica save some for 871 tomorrow am!
@virginamerica why is it taking 12 years to fly home to dallas? get your shit together.
@virginamerica @jezziegoldz club virgin is bumping in new york http://t.co/haqc7gdg7c
@virginamerica @jezziegoldz would have been a rough trip but luckily we were on a #virginamerica flight. #weather
@virginamerica is that #thestarter??😁
@virginamerica ...please come to minneapolis st. paul!
@virginamerica yes for your information my bff
@virginamerica another perfect flight. how come on your planes the sun visors can stay down? other carriers make you raise them?
nice retweet @virginamerica: the man of steel might be faster but we have wifi – just saying. #sciencebehindtheexperience http://t.co/fgrbpazsix
@virginamerica i love the dancing little richard. cool beans.
@virginamerica i don’t use passbook =/ i still love you though &lt;3 :) i’ll just use my email in the future.
@virginamerica thanks for the free birthday points! y'all are all right with me!
@virginamerica do you have an application for ios? was looking and only saw virgin mexico :( &lt;/3
@virginamerica man of steel flies to more cities though...and with more frequency too.

@virginamerica good point!
.@virginamerica i heard he has a virgin mobile hotspot ;)
@virginamerica you got cheese plate flights too.
@virginamerica on all your flights?
@virginamerica dad on segway is the best part of this whole infographic!
@virginamerica are there any plans for a short haul airline in europe? would defiantly fly with you guys :)
@virginamerica wifi and better seating.
@virginamerica how come abc is the only one of the network channels you do not have?
@virginamerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
.@virginamerica not only was it great but you return my calls the day after. could not ask for more. #myvxexperience
@virginamerica while other airlines were not cancelled flighting flights into bos and helping their customers get home virgin was saying good luck!
@virginamerica dear virgin customer while you're stranded in sf for 3 days &amp; $1000cost- we'll do the very least we can to accommodate you!
@virginamerica should use this in their next airline commercial laugh out loud :: http://t.co/pxexilsjbs
@virginamerica grouping virgin in with the others now. bos weather has exposed their actual cus serv model. never flight booking problems with virgin again!
@virginamerica as one of the travelers affected by the boston storm i am shocked at virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
@virginamerica umm so no reason as to why this is? is there someone different i should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
@virginamerica trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)…tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
@virginamerica so loyal that i am driving to #nyc from #pa to fly virgin since you cut #philly flights ;)
@virginamerica any way to change from main cabin to main cabin select (on same flight) without paying a change fee penalty?
@virginamerica you guys are perfect as always! &lt;3 #wervirgin
@virginamerica thanks! y'all have some of the best customer service left in the industry.
@virginamerica can you give me silver status for 12 months?
@virginamerica really wish you'd fly out of #fargo @fargoairport those fares are amazings
@virginamerica mood lighting on point🙌 reclining my seat kickin up my feet💤
@virginamerica my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. any update on how long of a delay?
@virginamerica my group got their cancelled flightlation fees waived but i cannot because my ticket is booked for 2/18? your reps were no help either 😡
@virginamerica are there any sign up bonuses to enroll in elevate?
@virginamerica just got on the 1pm in newark home to la. your folks at ewr are incredible #letsgohome
@virginamerica morning. if i have a question regarding elevate points &amp; flights can i direct message you?
@virginamerica still waiting to see @starryeyes_dev_ 😞
@virginamerica was wondering if you guys recieved my direct message and we're able to potentially respond as soon as possible
@virginamerica flying los angeles to sfo and after looking at the awesome movie lineup i actually wish i was on a long haul.
“@virginamerica: book out of town with fares from $59/way (+restr). http://t.co/xrdtov7nl8 http://t.co/4y78byackc” @jenniferdawnpro
@united thanks
@united thanks for taking care of that mr!! happy customer.
@united still no refund or word via dm. please resolve this issue as your cancelled flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
@united delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... still need to improve service #united
@united thanks -- we filled it out. how is our luck with this? is it common?
@united your eri-ord express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an eri-ewr hop! :)
@united even on international flight glasgow to the u.s.? then what about orlando to newark? all 90 mins?
@united you think you boarded flight au1066 too early? i think so.
@united i understand but it is tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. it is a steep price.
@united gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. if you have a way to prevent the constant issues that would rock.
@united flying gla-mco in a few weeks. how long do we have to be at airport for before departure for both international and domestic? ta
@united thanks
@united thanks. it is on the same ticket.
@united why not? is it a law or a policy?
@united is the worst. nonrefundable first class tickets? oh because when you select global/fc their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
@united @cheertymedad so i can buy tix 3 days before flight but cannot transfer the tix. flawed security logic. flawed customer service
@united i did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic am i really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.ridiculous!
@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ♥
@united no i do not but i am sure united have my information on its system.
@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one this is not a pair of shoes it is a necessity for my child
@united just submitted my response on the link you sent.
@united yes david allan send an email with this number (kmm24999563v99860l0km) and case#8719519
@united @highbuddyyy that totally sucks my cousin worked at phl said @united
@united just wanted to let you know how wonderful rosetta the gate agent was working flight 6457 daniel to ase. let her know she wasappreciated
@united yes a paper voucher that i got on january 26th 2015
@united beginning of february i called united they said they would send another voucher by mail. never got anything. #tiredofwaiting
@united the internet is a great thing. i am emailing executives in your company maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner.
@united do i need to use a chase united club pass for my 8yr old son or can he come in with me on my pass?
@united and what am i suppose to do with that number?
@united i flew back w other company since united didnt have an earlier flight
@united i lost a voucher that i was given in miami aeroport on january 26. i did not use it.
@united i am trying to book awards for september and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
@united i sure did. i had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag. i would like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
@united @cheertymedad gee that's like almost caring about people more than $$. think i am more int in having a trusted adult w/ daughter .
@united see? we were told repeatedly that the pilot was late flight and kept getting late flightr. after we boarded there was a defibrillator issue.
@united why no preferred security line anymore. my tsa pre-check did not pull on my @silverairways partner flight! #platinum #spoiled
@united #newarkliberty airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals a&amp;c. #flyingainteasy
@united yes please! i am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! it seems so easy but...
@united how does united refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane did not take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
@united also during the run i was instructed to do i shattered my computer. http://t.co/oaflfr7wxb
@united yes we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. one of the agents have been very rude but thankfully ladan has been nice.
@united that's right- with an overnight miami.
@united have clients with an 11 hr layover at iah (during the day). will they have to claim &amp; recheck luggage. or will it be taken care of?
@united i am trying to find out if the loaner seat is new or used a used car seat is illegal according to safety regulations
@united i dmed you the details
@united iah to charlotte. baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer
@united kewl. will also let them know the overhead bin over my row was inop. i love a good abbreve.
@united - thanks for your help...got me what i need but its an issue with @_austrian . i guess i sit awhile longer.
@united @uctraveladvisor - i would have loved to respond to your website until i saw the really long form. in business the new seats are bad
@united a refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
@united then why have i not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am i supposed to go anywhere with my child
@united thanks again for your concern. i will contact customer care upon our return from australia.
@united well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
this is where cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/9v8tmusjvu
@united no i need you guys to not over book planes. it is not a concern i will just travel with someone else moving forward.
@united a measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during ua1116. #unacceptable
@united when will email address/username sign-on be available? it is been a while.
@united thank you for that. am i able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
@united rude rude
@united - why cannot i get a boarding pass for my austrian airlines codeshare flight. rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; i am stuck outside second
@united. ..i received on other flights. #united truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
@united just flew to #telaviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which did not even make it on the plane! besides for the impolite service...
@united my bag is still in colo springs. i am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. not a good outcome
@united shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules. even calling from neurosurgery icu is not enough!
@united no. denver said they do not handle baggage that made it to colo. springs. they gave me an 800 number to call. no help there either.
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle your mistakes
@united 6533 ordinance to dca
@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. was told we cannot find a supervisor.
@united zcc82u cancelled flight flight 16h in advance??? need connect flight reschedule so the link is not helping. help!? gf waited months to see me.
@united i will not be flying you again
@united in addition my first flight was delayed an hour and i am arriving at my destination 8 hours late flight.
@united cancelled flighted our flight did not rebook us on added flight now have to drive from a denver to kc....thanks!
@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. my disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. do i preboard?
@united i flew united last month and the experience was awesome!
@united our travel booked through united group dept. okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in lax.
@united versus upset with your disability services. when i told one of your employees i was carrying medical equipment she was very rude.
@united thnx for quick reply but do not think you can assist. our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 year old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? wow!!
@united @getmeontop 7 weeks late flightr and i still have not received my miles from the mileageplus gift card $150 starbucks card i handed over!!!
@united as a 1k i am always hoping for improvement.
@united not yet. i complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. unfortunate coincidence i hope?
@united okc ticket agent roger mclarren(sp?) less than helpful with our intl group travel problems cannot find a supervisor for help.
@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each os category. it is expensive to get right .
@united another fail for the united ticket agents in okc. less than helpful and could care less about our problems. american here we come.
@united 441 which also had 1 working wc in coach. good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. i have to use the wc stat.
@united the os is not controlled by me but rather @verizonwireless . app is new.
@united i just sent an email to customer care telling them i may have to break up with you 😢. i sincerely hope they can help me!!
@united silly i am flying delta today. your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@united what is your phone number. i cannot find who to call about a flight reservation.
@united well you cannot fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it.
@united why am i to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? like i said i want a number to someone who can fix what you did.
@united they helped me at the baggage service desk. said bc tsa screening was down in fll not all bags made it but bag will be in ewr @ 12
@united mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. second time this week... hmm.
@united for the record- rozana at newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
@united it was last night's 1235/ord-lga.
@united thanks for update
@united thank you !
@united direct message these nuts
@united had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew does not read them? (continued)
@united i tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in houston. i was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@united #worst2unitedflightsever ua 236 las to iad 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
@united despite my bag not making it to newark good informative email tracking updates help!
@united. what's going on with ua 236? outbound flight last thursday was delayed 4hrs how long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
@united #worst2unitedflightsever ua1429 iad to las 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@united crashed trying to check in.
@united wow. what a deal. again 30+ plus seats available. easy change to make a customer happy.
@united thanks for the information i already knew...
@united airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aqjn4hwnac we negotiate resolutions for you!
@united on 768 to logan - boarding gong show due to los angeles carry on enforcement. bins full of coats = no room for bags. you need a better system!
@united thank you.
@united blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in san francisco airport. terrible service from rep #scam
@united is there an email address i can reach? too long for a dm.
@united disappointed that you didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for your mistakes. taking my business elsewhere ✌️out.
@united ua1673 still waiting! supposed to depart 9:08
@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
@united okay it is now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. i gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! terrible service
@united does this process ever end? still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@united what's going on with your website? i am flight booking problems three tickets today and i have been booted off the system umpteen times.
@united how do i get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@united so do i need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
@united i received 1 bag last night i am still missing the other one.
@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too even in economy plus it is like sitting on a concrete bench.
@united please help baby hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.she needs your help.pls donate/rt http://t.co/kqnrrp86a5
@united bet you wont honour them like mine ey
@united second flight also delayed no pilots! but they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
@united i guess that's too much ask huh?
@united but it is hard to stay upset at someone when they at least try to show remorse.
@united by the way a simple apology goes a long way even if it is a hollow one. it is obvious that you do not care about me or my well-being
@united this is not a one time thing either! it is a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@united fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
@united it is an incredibly easy fix but you would rather stay in your comfort zone while i get forced out of mine.
@united ours in july. you have zero excuses for this. you have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@united everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. they booked their tickets in october and december. we bought
@united not sure what you are talking about. she is going on nonstop flights. sna to sfo and then sfo to ewr.
.@united it will be because i am moving to @americanair because of @united talk no service
@united please be good to me this weekend!
@united i asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems and got back an unrelate flightd copy/paste. you can do better.
@united what time? who can i call. i need my skis. i will go to the airport and get them. no more faith in united.
@united i see you guys are at it again. amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
@united a tourist wonder: super tides and tide of the century at french and u.k coasts: http://t.co/gxdqortss0
@united yeah sorry but there's always a problem with united. and you have an international reputation for having problems.
@united you all should probably work on that.
@united but then again maybe the @bbbne_sd_ks_ia would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
@united i wonder if sharing all this on fb and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@united could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@united yes please! trying to get to pop- in newark now....
@united you have to follow me in order for me to dm...come on now
@united $25 united coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight seriously? #ridiculousness #learncustomerservice
@united so they did not drop my bag overnight &amp; now i am leaving for a week. this is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
@united i did direct message the details but still no response. i have to book today.
@united i know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at heathrow ?
@united not able to direct message you my confirmation number
@united i have sent the message let me know if you got it. i am not very twitter-literate. also is he really going to be stuck for 18hrs?
@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on second february ref.8441639. awful customer service!
@united direct message does not work what do i do?

@united i am not a child. i am someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. you
@united how does it get cancelled flightled 10 hours before take off?
@united this always happens with you guys and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. is that good business to you?
@united so what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him is not next to him?
@united i am seeking to go 2 client. b/c you cant get me there i need refund. i filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
.thnx for the response @united bot. it seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. is your first class service really only worth $50?
@united has unrivalled access to #california with flights to the u.s. from 7 uk airports with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round
@united booked award tix on thaiairways but i am not seeing a conf# for them just the united flight booking problems#. can you get get the thai# for me?
@united luckily i made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got cancelled flighted?
@united service so far has been horrid. we wanted to end the trip on a high note. guess that's not an option.
@united booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancée and i. we got 2 middle seats. unacceptable. the
@united you guys are horrible.
@united thnx for the information
@united why do i have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket? #pennypincher
@united ok. to top things off you've lost my luggage. could you get any worse??? #unitedairlines
@united kudos for not cancelled flightling flights from dfw this morning. united usually first to panic...
@united and my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
@united is flight 587 from dfw to ordinance currently on-time? i see an advisory that dfw may be affected by weather
@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mjkpgvxmpc
@united flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ord-seriously???
@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice captain steve connolly.
@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
@united i had not filed a refund claim as i was told there was no charge by your dm. this is disputed by my bank hence why i would like(1/2)
@united did bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. we're pretty curious #unitedairlines
@united every united flight between saipan and guam is an adventure! you never know when @capeair's old plane will be operational :)
@united hence why i have been asking for the customer service phone number so i can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
@united did our bags leave washington yet? that would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #unitedairlines #lostluggage
@united so if i am flying first class just one leg to chicago but not on my long flight to china am i still able to use the lounge in chicago
@united according to your dms i am not owed a refund. please may i be provided with a contact number before i go to my bank to file claim
@united about 3 hours ago. i need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
@united okay thank you
@united i have filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. is there another way to do this?
@united please properly train your agents. requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. not even open at this hr
@united thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. oh wait you forgot. iceland should be fun with no clothes....
@united thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. time just flew by.
@united customer service is atrocious! you have disrupted my travel plans you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to talk to a human
@united terminal at mia should have food open before 5am especially when there are flights at 6am. two hours early like recommended. cannot eat.
@united it was ua flight 1001! now i am currently stuck in portland because i missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #getmartyhome
@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers does anyone know the uk customer service number for #unitedairlines
@united how we looking on getting those bags to lusaka
@united could you update me on the suitcase please? the online and phone tracking told me nothing. i was told i would have it back yesterday!
@united thank you. been trying for two days to set this up.
@united just 1 last thing. you guys should not be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
@united lhr arrival lounge #fail. waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. you know how many passengers you carry. planning???
@united any luck with finalizing my reservation? i direct messaged information to you. please let me know what else you need. want to confirm asap. thanks
@united completed form but doubt it is any use. ua does not care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. sure ua won't feel responsibility for that...
@united definitely a compliment! i really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. in the end i am a happy customer
@united thanx so much. you followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
@united this will definitely be a trip to remember ewr-sti second of the season first on seat 35a because it pays to be loyal!
@united nope they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. even though they assured us we would get a room...
@united keep me updated. let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
@united frankly worse customer service ever. problems will happen how you deal defines a company. never again united.
@united it is still a valid flight. just seems strange to delay for late flight inbound crew 7 hours from now when the plane is already here.
@united thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1k desk!
@united it is too bad ua has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
@united i would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
@united if i pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when i arrive. why should i have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we cannot leave! #fail
@united you are one great airline ❤️
@united outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. what is your logic? and why? am i writing to a machine? human help required
@lindaswc @united: we do not like to hear you had a poor experience. please share details w/our customer care team http://t.co/hisc4ndmgz.
@united no cancelled flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in late flight. getting runaround for 3 hrs. each employee blaming previous 1.
@united this is not a local united number for malaysia 0011 800-55558000. what is your local united airlines here in kuala lumpur ( kul )?
@united okay ase24766m. find our luggage.
@united the agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on ua1116 would have to be taken up online...
@united i send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com. bg0kwm narayanan. please respond asap. also no local united telephone # @ kul
@united thanks! will you guys be getting the a380s anytime soon?
@united but they are not... lady one phone says its in telephone aviv. telephone aviv united says its in newark. no one knows and i have nothing...
“@united: @melaniespring we'll see what we can do. ^kn” we are running! most of this plane is running. thanks for the help!
@united yes but still now answers. many have not had their luggage for 3 days! unacceptable!!
@united what is that going to do for you? nothing just like you always do
@united i sent in my feedback. thank you.
@united plus what about food? and taxis?
@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #fail
@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
@united the bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. hope you're having a good night. thanks.
@united yes i do.
@united i take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us a so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
@united on 4124 arriving two hours late flight into clt. now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. unhappy customer.
@united airlines is the absolute worst. they have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #unitedairlines
@united thanks; might want to fix this line: our customer care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days.
@united we just flew with united from aus (austin bergstrom) to cancun intl. best flight ever! the 737's are not too big... not too small!
@united it is frustrating as a frequent flyer loyal since continental. upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
@united deep vein thrombosis
@united at its worse. cannot figure how to pack plane screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in san fran for stranded pax. way to go!
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. wtf??!! http://t.co/zfqmpgxvs6
hey @united why does the flight from iah to positive leave so late flight and the one back to iah so early? i rather get to positive earlier
@united lost bag process is broken. agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. as you can see nobody is there. flight to austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
@united unfortunately still on the tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #gonnabealongnight
“@united: @darquenloveli we regret to hear this. please let us know if you need assistance. ^kn” i was finally able to secure my seat. thanks
@united what time does check in open for flight no ua80 from manchester to newark today ?
@united good to know you will open the closed doors for premier passengers after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed.
@united direct message sent
@united yea get me to phoenix already. delays all day with you people. it is bullshit.
@united if it is any consolation your staff was stellar. just not the hour+ delays i encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
@united flight ua3576 gate b1. and tell ray i somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of iah and did not have to wait for the 917 one. :)
@united that's unfortunate. the @tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
@united but thanks for asking
@united lost bags. cancelled flightled flights. delhi call centers. poor united staff spread thin and stressed. you name it.
@united yes. does not make that mistake any less absurd. does not change the fact that i am very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@united i am constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. in order to prevent dvt i have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xc6jq70r7b
@united in ordinance waited 20 minute after crew members left before gate items came. flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away.
@united follow me back please and i will happily direct message you the link because i would rather not share my travel plans publicly.
@united you too!
@united is my favorite airline.
@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you would not
@united we needed them here asap. will they make it on today's flight?
@united agent split up my reservation? now cannot cancelled flight and refund credit for 2wks? why
@united our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( the change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. can you help?
@united i sent the message. let me know asap.
@united why would they make me share a room?
@united tried calling too but w/25 minute phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to bwi to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from san diego? pretty please?
@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
@united for an early flt i think a call is appropriate. yes reviewed and nada available until next day. expect full refund
@united i understand thanks
@united again i ask who can i call to get this fixed? tweeting me bs questions to stall only makes things worse. phone number please.
@united yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #helpimstuck #united
@united it is highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that i should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
@united well considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else why waste more time to hear 'call corp'
@united man i cannot wait to book my ticket now! thanks jp you're a life sabe
@united ice which i totally understand. but when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight cancelled flightations it seems like
@united flt 1249 cancelled flightled and i get email @3:30 am? what happened to courtesy phn call? had to book difference airline &amp; city
@united tag numbers 0016 964012 0016 964077 0016 964078 - let us find these bags.
@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum consider revisiting your terrible provide a death certificate' policy
@united well the bar is set low! you guys are really good at the apology game! what will change? when will you guys learn?
@united my post was just more of disappointment. i am a frequent united flyer it was a simple ??. 1 bad apple does not spoil the bunch.
@united you guys continue to impress me in houston. http://t.co/cih1qnllcm
@united i have no way of making phones calls... need to handle via twitter/email/web. thank you!
@united please help... i am in ethiopia adopting a two year old child. have an existing confirmation #. need to add child to reservation.
@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? if so where?
@united your website deserves a new design. #html5 ftw!
@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @flyyow
@united twitter is not letting me direct message you..
@united i hope so too
@united agent helps the person in front of me. finishes up with them and then walks away. the guy behind me is as shocked as i am.
@united connection at ordinance was on the exact same plane again. checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in chicago. pretty ridiculous.
@united not encouraged that i will have my cpap tonight.
@united yes. did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. got an email that its found but not schedule for delivery
@united an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
@united delay den-cle because they have to manually enter baggage tags? really? worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
@united why tell us flight is delayed then tell us it is on time again with 20 minute to spare? do not say it is delayed unless you're sure!
@united yes in lusaka zambia. my guess is the bags never made the plane at iad.
@united where is my flight voucher?
@united late flight to denver late flight to newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. unacceptable.
@united has once again let me down. do not think i have ever flown with them and not had problems. worst airline period.
@united yes i filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. ridiculous as i had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@united ua938 ord-lhr. bags are being loaded 30min late flight. frigid air into cabin! plane feels like falling apart! upgrade long haul fleet!
@united flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea) and not once checked up on me. what gives? #ua6076 #notcool
@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. was this a #cyberattack?
@united after our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we are home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big pb&amp;j sandwich.
@united @americanair spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
@united ua276 sitting at ewr nearly an hour after sked. pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave. can you help?
@united @americanair so that's it? it just ends there? come on! i traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
@united made the upgrade list. will fly first tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! 🙌 #statusmatchpaidoff http://t.co/atfrkp6goy
@united not just refunded but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in dia
@united thanks for the reminder. it is been a fun ride. http://t.co/ppva4rch9f
@united i received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when i arrived. i am asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@united updated a320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. i do not get it. how can i charge devices?
@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. i just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
@united 5 gate changes two delays. even the crew thinks the airline sucks
@united i am very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight information off the app. that's just ridiculous keep people updated!
@united soooo it is been 15 days and you've offered no response. so i assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
@united terrific. many thanks. looking forward to being back on ua tomorrow. had a great flight up to vancouver.
@united calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2)
@united it is taken ~3 weeks for cust care to respond to case #8477733 requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. where can i get an update?
@united i appreciate your efforts getting me home!
@united that's correct—i've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
@united today was not your finest. all could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@united what is the real deal with the delay on flight ua 1032 from denver to vegas?
@united ua63 from madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 ua employees. maryjo was rude and unhelpful.
@united system failure again = bad trend. software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. currently sitting on the tarmac at ogg for over an hour.
@united rebooting chicago dispatch system need @pivotalcf as i am tired of sitting on planes
@united despite shaky connections looks like i will get home tonight. great job @united - was touch and go for a while..
@united http://t.co/hj5kq82chn however is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82chn.
@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to chicago.
@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
@united comically on the return flight from ase there were two united flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
@united grk13575m is the file reference
@united we would...how do i contact you to discuss? a few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
@united ua 746. pacific rim and date night cut out. not constantly or randomly but one spot repeatably.
@united been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@united i send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response. yet another reason why i will never fly with you again.
@united my mom left her kindle on flight 1544 today. burgundy case with a light. seat 27d. did anyone find it?
@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
@united is horrible!! they lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat safety regulations say it is illegal to use a used car seat
@united thank you.
decisions decisions @mandarinjourney @united: we'd love for you to try our service. we offer status match too. http://t.co/xbqqqbrgvf ^kp”

@united he needs to get to home the 24th they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. is there compensation or anything that can be done?
“@united: @mllovelace the baggage fee is waived for premier members. please see http://t.co/u6duw27mde. ^jp” what's the point of membership?
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. but why did i catch earlier flight? original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@united dmed you. thank you

@united @apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you cancelled flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #ph6rps
@united stressed and rude agents. overwhelmed by delyd flight las-den 1657. yelling at several people. not pretty. this is #friendlyskies??
@united landed in boston at 9 last night. the 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
@united fail you cancelled flightled our flight frm gjt and then used our reserv home to iah (from sea) for reflight booking problems w/out our permission!! #ph6rps
just sent thank you retweet @united: @goodenufmother please direct message your confirmation number if reflight booking problems is needed. thank you. ^ey
@united has made my no fly list. other airlines wait when connector late flight. stuck in iah.
@united so what’s the deal? do you provide voucher for overnight or am i cozy on the floor at #ohare ? #gross #helpmeplease #anyonethere
@united also the mere fact that i have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example.
@united thank you. i flew into newark from vail/eagle.
@united i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
@united now what?!? http://t.co/5hpsqvrjk8 flight was gone when i got off plane! #businesstravel #goodenoughmother
@united the proper response: sorry for your wait what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. that's how @delta would handle.
@united your customer service is terrible! stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours late flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
@united please upload the march on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ✈️
@united so you are inadequate by accident?

@united thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
@united boarding time shows 35 minute and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zcbjyo6lsn
@united agent in las letting 20 customers know they cannot help them rebook delayed flight to den #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/quzvmk2rtr
@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stclass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/loeco4gmvd
@united ...and when that does not work...
@united did you have seen my message today?? about a mcdonnell douglas dc 10 model?? i will hear it if you read it goodnight now
@united searched for mileage tickets to bom could not find a single one is saver awards - i see how you play. earn miles but cannot use them.
@united flight arrives 30 minutes early but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.
@united that's not the issue. the fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when she bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
@united thank you. we are signed up for notifications. we shall watch and wait! ❄️❄️
@united still waiting to hear back. my wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@united i would love if someone could get me back to austin tonight and i do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
@united i have a 0530 flight out of dfw on tuesday. how far in advance will you give notice if cancelled flightled?
@united i am signed up for notifications. this is the first trip i was not updated on. not sure why this happened.
@united thank you. took care of everything and made it right. that's the experience i am used to. opened the app to find flight changed.
@united that is not in line with your responses here. and now i am waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
@united i took the exact same aircraft in to los angeles 3 days ago. it fit no problem. the agent today told some nonsense about a policy change
@united your helpful agents in club helped. i am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @silverairways
@united never heard of this? http://t.co/qdebyahqfm
@southwestair does not charge ticket change fees. do they not incur the same mysterious costs that you incur @united?
@united exhausted &amp; frustrated! link to a fb post abt my travel issue https://t.co/larkc8vc4s
@united i was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. i am not a rookie. read my bio.
@united that's exactly the point. it fits. i am premier access. boarding group 2. this was a return ticket. i have been doing this for 15 years
@united i have never experienced worst customer service. placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@united currently on board so not now. check in was terrible. staff rude. expensive luggage thrown around etcetera.
@united fucked up then voided my ticket and kept my money. not even an apology. i will never fly with your airline again. #unitedairlines
@united has the worst customer svcs! this kevin rep at call center must be investigated. my baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
@united should not sell tickets for @silverairways on http://t.co/onhxhco6bk. has terrible service and ua staff cannot reach silver
@united just got demoted from gold cuz my husband got 100% of the pqd tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry.
@united thank you!
@united when will direct flights from belfast intl to newark resume from their winter break? thanks.
@united my favorite way to travel! thank you! http://t.co/vgn2x1ckg0
@united yes after this awful weather it appears i can get home
@united yes lots. you have terrible customer service at newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@united lovely new plane from lga to ordinance but no power outlets?
@united but if i tweet the id number won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?
@united i filed a delayed bag report on saturday! my flight was cancelled flightled and i never went anywhere!
@united the person is currently bettween gates 71a and 73 in los angeles
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the ewr baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse. i hope this is the last time i have to fly with you.
@united thank you for the quick response but i cannot direct message you until you follow me as well
@united icloud it is not there yet -- please help 917 703 1472
@united i need the phone number to baggage claim in los angeles my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on
@united i did... no response back
@united this is atrocious customer service.
@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
@united you cancelled flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for an hour on our vacation. why?
@united @dfpietra that's your response? shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. you can do better-from customer service to your apology
@united thanks! it is 35k miles from rtb to europe to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in us on way/way back- mileage diff?
@united of course i did. the bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
@united you are the worst. i will avoid you like the plague.
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@united someone needs to direct message me and resolve this correctly. extremely disappointed with the service i received. terrible management.
@united premier gold desk changes flight. waives fees. gives me wrong flight. now jana acosta in salt lake refuses the same service. angry.
@united i will give you one thing you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #alwaysdelayedonunited
@united i will but right now i am to angry
@united first time flying with united. also last time. #terrible back to @virginatlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #unitedairlines
@united i used to be a committed #continentalairlines flyer until merger. i remember now why i switched to @southwestair #communicationfail
@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just cancelled flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
@united i am saying i made the flight but with poor/non-communication unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around
@united i think direct message would be better
@united gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says late flight arriving aircraft tell the truth! @unfriendly
@united you are easily the worst company i have ever experienced. you have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you could not care less!....
@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to late flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@united already did that at the airport and 12 hours late flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
@united once united's service levels reaches those of etihad or lets be more realistically lufthansa then ill consider it again
@united really? someone called in sick and then someone forgot to call a replacement?! now an hour late flight to take off. #theworst
@united asked flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free tv. #unacceptable
@united done
@united thank you ^jh appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so.
@united has been such a disappointment today. simply put. rather unpleased with things currently. flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
@united during the same round trip my non-english speaking friend was stranded twice for 12+ hours each time! most staff members were rude.
@united found a group of people who actually hates people more than isis thats right united airlines.
@united nope. walked up &amp; down the orf terminal &amp; not a united agent to be found. showed up @ last minute to board us. many panicked people
@united thank you
@united by the time i finally get to dallas i could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
@united i am trying to get to my final destination we need compensation. just about 2hrs of personal time wasted.
@united that guy really has no customer service clue.could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
@united he has no priority and iove it
@united pleased to be a premier platinum
@united how can you not put my bag on plane to seattle. flight 1212. waiting in line to talk to someone about my bag. status should matter.
@united @campilley hahaha. if they were not an american company i would say this was great sarcasm!!
@united i think he actually did not like your screen @campilley 😃😃😃
@united apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
@united it is a shame choosing #united may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #poorservice
@united hi guys do you have a general enquires email address please? thanks david.
@united just checking in again - what is the status of our claim. it is going on 2 months with no attention to this? we are very upset.
@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in lit and caused me to miss my connection at iah to msy. can you help?
@united #unitedairlines please fix #aspenbaggagefail issues. had to pay my own way to #aspen after flight cancelled flight. left us in the cold in den.
@united read my bio. see who i work with. i have never encountered this with your airline before. disappointed is an understatement.
@united does customer care have email or a phone rep that i can speak with? we had so many issues they cannot be placed in 2000 characters?
thank you “@united: @truu_tall i can certainly take a look. please follow and direct message me your confirmation number for assistance. ^jh”
@united in the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in florida. they called #united for an alternate flight #noanswer
@united i am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip car seat? required? if not- then allowed? can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?
@united thanks for listening! i definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
@united we've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently ua1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #wtf #fb
@united thank you. mention that before i boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag and it was another woman. men not asked.
@united cannot leave the tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 minute now counting a 100 people maximum #epicfailunited
@united that's real dedication &amp; concern. your apologies do not fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues i have had over the past 6 mos.
@united blocked me from dm'ing them because they would rather i complain about them in a public forum
@united ok. i just submitted. thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
@united big thanks to ms. winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. she really went the extra mile!
@united i will as soon as i am done with my article. thanks! ~tom
@united booked flights for 2 for $779. was charged $389.50 twice. means i cannot redeem cc points properly. would have gone elsewhere.
@united we've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. whats up with that?
@united pedophile airline. split myself and my 10 year old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. horrible.
@united arriving 25 minutes early is nice but not if equipment is not ready. waiting 30 minutes for luggage so far. time gains wiped out.
@united is doing musicians real dirty at lax. i have never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
@united i am rebooked now but the line was 300 people deep.
.@united for those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bdtldx2
@united @flyeia yes they said it took more than an hour!
@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a cc holder.
@united okay thank again for your help!
@united not a happy flyer. ua flight 1161 from sfo to cleveland. sunday 2/22. stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/vdfdodqvgx
thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on ua6366
@united flight 1491...plane from sfo to den is basically on time.
@united thanks. just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. i changed it back.
@united 20 minute more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. will strand many of us overnight at ordinance due to missed cnxns
@united heads up we did not check 8 bags 2 we checked arrived those are not claim #s for our 2. other people's bags? http://t.co/dplq3mhqgd
@united this must be a drone “@united: @keambleam we understand your frustration. our bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you...
@united change made in just over 3 hours. for something that should have taken seconds online i am not thrilled. loved the agent though.
@united flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding english doesn’t mean they are deaf. stop yelling english slowly to them.
@united not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i cancelled flighted.
@united well that's big of you but i do not have terribly high expectations at this point.
@united it is like you're trying to make me hate your airline. fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 👿
@united nice your app says us 4972 delayed by weather. pilot says waiting on fuel. one in your control one not
@united please than robin at ewr premiere desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. she did the work. huge thanks.
@united okay thank you do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since i will have to stay overnight?
@united i was originally trying to share details but the link jimmy samartzis vice president - customer experience sent me expired.
@united really? 3 hr delay 4 gate changes &amp; you boarded us sent us back up &amp; boarded us again. won't change our flight. can we go now?
@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the app so i can just activate it and surf...
@united i did. the ac went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the mojave desert. #pressurecooker #heattrap
@united nope - still no one helped me. giving up on united. #badservice
@united 8602947 jon at http://t.co/58tutgli0d thanks.
@united when an airline causes the missed connection you would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
@united i would thank you - but you did not help. taking 6 hours to reply (so i get a message in the middle of the night) is not actually helpful
@united flight ua1270 is descending into farce and we have not left ewr yet. is this going to get any worse?
@united i was told it was due to be on ua23 which flies direct to dublin so why did it go to london? this is a complete shambles!
@united 45+ minute at ewr baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
flight booking problems for a travel writers trip i am hosting and need to be happy when i land! do you have the cute pjs aa does? @united
but i do not see aa @united
@united did you find out where it is? thanks
@united on a standby to denver which has been delayed and a confirmed to aspen whose flights have been cancelled flighted all day. 0 confidence.
@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/nfaqhhr09j
@united at what point do you just cancelled flight! finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. what a day! #missedwork #clientnothappy http://t.co/suprlfoi8t
@united thank you for your kindness. your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
@united do not see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. no airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
@united woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hours early. barely made flight then 3 hours layover in sfo - wanted to hop on earlier option
@united i will do delayed baggage claim when i land. hopefully the bag is not broken into damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints
@united done. want me to send a screen shot of the second call which is now at over 45 minutes?
@united look at this beauty 😉 dc 10 united airlines 😉 http://t.co/mvyoizrpde
@united thanks! i will fill up the form as soon as i land. i do not like being duped so i hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
@united this is the line in denver to rebook due to weather issues. do better. http://t.co/tmccexyaaq
@united the ones who suffer. i understand delays i do not understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent.
@united 2 cancelled flighted flights late flightr agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then cancelled flighted it. coworker got on flight- now delayed. now?
@united of urgency but this is ridiculous. your Chief Executive Officer claims to be customer focused yet when delays happen planes sit and customers are
@united i was not asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
@united flight was scheduled for 11:56 it is 1:05 and we have not moved. i have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense
@united okay thx!
@united i cannot direct message you so here is the confirmation # g8cvwj - please is there any way i can make it to kailua tonight? thank you
@united go to hell
@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor why do not you reserve o/head space above those seats? in 1b on ua246 - not impressed
@united definitely will!
@united would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time information on boarding passes for delayed flights
@united 18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 cancelled flightations. late flightst reason crew needed mandatory sleep. in mexico!
@united great to hear thankyou so much. greatly appreciate your replies. feel much more settled now.
@united counter agents at rdu deserve a medal. #thankyou
the saga of the @melissaafrancis bag delay w/ @united - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? stay tuned.
@united flight 211/ord gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag i have used for 15 years! flight crew was more reasonable!
@united thank you. literally called for preboarding as i ran up.
@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
@united it was ua381 on 14 feb. point is overselling flights= bad. making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse
@united that's brilliant thankyou so much. is it classed as part of carryon?
@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. i appreciate you working with me
@united we've been here since 3am and you've cancelled flightled our flight twice
@united no chance i wait in ordinance all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. hold 5396
@united ua5396 can wait for me. i am on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to b. this is crap.
@united from mexican nrt (dates tbd) but i am getting a 200 to 300 usd difference in my quotations through september when compared to mexican bkk
@united fails again. @southwestair saves the day.
@united better just keep connection from ordinance to fwa that boards in ten minutes open until i get off the plane that just landed an hour late flight
@united is there a united gold number? i have been on hold 24 minutes and think i may be lost in nowhereland. have a gold reservation. help.
@united great! i am ready to go home.

@united. it is not my first time flying to the us. i have medical info. looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on?
@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
@united oh we are sure it is not planned but it occurs absolutely consistently it is usually the only yyj flight that's cancelled flightled daily.
@united @jms2802 : outsource it all united airlines...your customers are just loving you for it. outsource. outsource. outsource.
@united hi im flying sfo-lax-sal-clo. my connecting time in los angeles is 1h45m. is it enough time? do i have to collect my bag and recheck on av?
@united thank you! you need to follow back tho otherwise i cannot direct message you. x
@united it is not getting any better. i would suggest you get a senior manager to this gate then retrain these gate people
@united states faundation was by faith judeo cristian@not it was by ideologias.@ http://t.co/mwbk68k0a3
@united @jms2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead united puts out a video of timco doing wifi.
@united just sent! thanks :)
@united already missed connection ugh
@united @jms2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite timco who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft.
@united how do i formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. i was denied boarding &amp; i now lost my bag. help!
@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. not given any info.
@united flight 3763 iad-sat. we're on the outdoor track for an hour
@united - seriously it is 2015?!?! no wifi on a 5hr flight from cle-sfo #1589. you're the only airline w/out wifi...and please no 'unwind' bs.
@united you would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight. #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
@united what a pointless tweet. at least @americanair asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@united that's not even an apology
@united that's cool - now what?
@united - seriously it is 2015?!?! no wifi on a 5hr flight from cle-sfo #1589. you're the only airline without wifi...
@united b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. so gross. http://t.co/755vpym4mv
@united are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20? ordinance abq 3709. i cannot even take a walk without missing a change.
@united hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when i actually get on a flight as well as compensation for my hotel room
@united either is fine. however plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine.
@united @retailbagholder hahaha. at least they gave you a refund.
@united your sfo-yyj fight is cancelled flightled several times each week why even bother?
@united and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane broke. why am i global services status on an airline that's unsafe? stunning
@united how do i get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the cancelled flightation?
@united awesome flight crew on ua1589 re the plane the jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!
@united in 2015 united is unable to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the yyz check-in counter - wow smh #customerservice
@united e-ticket # 0162389030167 refund request # 16866853 case id # 8465981
@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they cannot figure it out! awesome service... not!
@united last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to sick pilot. no compensation. they do. not. care.
@united only thing confusing me is why i lost priority boarding? i am a mileage plus card member 😔
@united we're hoping to hear from you actually.
@united shes been rescheduled for today but with the frigid cold being a possible reason for maintenance it could be the same issue 2day
@united it is the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than maintenance.
@united b) i contacted you directly and the phone service was laissez faire at best. the problem is not a cancelled flightled a flight.
@united a) she's an international. her phone is on the fritz i had to get to chicago from nearly 4 hours away to figure everything out.
@united sorry for the delayed response. it was ua #381 chicago to san fran. held up for almost an hour on the tarmac. also lost my bags
@united okay thanks if you could please update me. i was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
@united thank you very much for the help. we're do i pick up my bags aspen airport &amp; are they coming in today on flight911
@united gate c 24 iad. you released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleon bridge while next flight board http://t.co/hfof33iyhi
@united i would say most of the public cannot extend their vacation a week point is why advertise multiple flights you cannot honor?
@united cancelled flights flt from ewr. no crew.tells wife &amp; 4 year old to get to ny to catch @aircanada to yyz! good #customerservice is dead.
@united now arriving a day and a half late flightr than supposed to. lesson of the day do not believe verbal or written confirmations from united
@united but you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
@united arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually do not have an electronic ticket
@united 1.75 hour delay. nothing says sorry like a voucher. missing time with family. #family #precioustime
@united after speaking to a united customer service rep the night before a flight confirming that everything is okay with your reservation..
@united has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. shameful http://t.co/6kqlhvap7g
@united is unfriendly screw family that hates kids and moms. now waiting on ua871... pray its better fyvrfn ..due to agent error and tickt

@united thanks for the update.
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. it is easy to say sorry on twitter but you should help your people @ewr
@united i guess. but what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. weather too?
@united now you have cancelled flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? what's going on? follow me so i can direct message details.
@united has it departed? i was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. had to stay overnight (again).

@united just confirmed a seat! crisis averted! beers won't be missed now
@united was that english? i will direct message though i do not think you'll make a plane appear.
@united looks like today will be my sixth consecutive delayed flight from you...do i win a prize??? @southwest air why do not you fly to sba? 😭
@united sitting in a plane with no pilot. thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
@united understood and thanks! i should have tried reaching out sooner.
@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
@united received hotel but no food. also email for 3750 miles. last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for cancelled flightlation?
@united do we know why ua5282 is delayed x2)? this is getting crazy. i have already had 2 overnight delays. #unitedairlines
@united follow back and i will give you the details.
@united and most frustratingly all this delay happened either at the gate or even onboard the aircraft! no heads up in advance!!!
@united the den b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. the mpagent at check in? she sucks. @seanmfmadden @peterstraubmma @jmercadomma @tonysimsmma
@united my ua3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours stretching my trip way past the midnight extremely exhausting!
@united ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. too late flight for that. just fly on time for once.
@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. now my ua4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
@united traveling with @megzezzo who is injured. gate agent in chicago was awesome helping her. thank you #roadwarrior
@united #unitedairlines how long will1531 be delayed.

@united jh thanks so much for reaching out. i was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes.
@united 3866 is at a stand still! no pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! problem was fixed 30mins ago. flight is as is delayed!
@united please see dm!!
@united. is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff could not police the overhead bins?
@united please message me a # for customer service. i will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
@united an hour delay because you cannot print a piece of paper!
@united still no response??
@united 4 people mci to del. preferably with jet airways ewr-bru-del segment. anytime in december
@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust second should have done that for me
@united there is no reference number. your agent told me to just drive to the airport because i cannot reach anyone there to deliver...
@united slightly better. crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
@united my credit card was charged on the transaction when i was told it would not be. if the charge goes through i will be contacting you.
@united my pqms and pqds are no longer showing up correctly in my mileageplus acct. how can i get this fixed?
@united thanks!

@united been solved they finally picked up the second time i called thanks for the response jh! 7:21 to dulles works!
@united need to work on your #united #flierfriendly program. at the very least clue in your flight attendants.
@united space. doctors' notes and everything. and on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. among other issues- not pleased with #united
@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead

@united how about starting without the robotic response?
@united i already did.
@united you cannot control turbulence but you can control customer experience lot of scared people up here.
@united currently on ua862 20 minutes of the worst turbulence i have ever experienced and zero communication from the flight deck.
@united yes but it is not looking. the ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a miami flight then to doctor
@united i have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. and when i write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up first class for $500

@united no thanks. i am sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. i am never flying united again.
@united current hold time after speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
@united i understand people make mistakes but do not code something in a way that we cannot get reimbursed when it is your fault. just blatant lie
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in new jersey because of a missed connection.
@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it is our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
.@united not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
@united where is my receipt! i upgraded return leg and 6 months late flightr still no receipt! http://t.co/dajwzhlvyu
@united how is it that i book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out i have no seat? wtf.
@united they're not actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reflight booking problems. missed the only flight to sti. awful.
@united i am not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! other than promises from your Chief Executive Officer service has gotten worse!
@united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) did not work entire ord-dca flight this morning
@united cancelled flightled my direct flight newark-brussels last night now 7 hours behind schedule. in eu compensation would be a given but in us?
.@united you may dislike delays but i paid you .we had an agreement that i paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time.
@united #epicfail on #cx as flight from frankfurt to san francisco now going to chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay
@united direct message sent as requested. make sure you follow back so you can direct message me back. thanks
@united please help http://t.co/t5mrj5yw6i
@united making sure your flights are not delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
@united hilarious
@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
@united why is my ktn not showing on my boarding? why is tsa pre-check not applying to my boarding pass?
@united your bag may or may not be at the airport. unfortunately no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages.
@united funny i paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is begging folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
@united nope not here. you need a little red stamp from the counter. check yourself before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0prgysvurm
@united was not trying to cancelled flight just trying to change my award ticket same date and place but thanks for sending the link i know the fee

@united sitting in the middle for the first time .. hope it works out well
@united you need a bag bouncer. get it together
@united and learn how to book flights. http://t.co/mhhs9ruplv
@united @showexpert what is going on with united's mileage program? you pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as pqd credit?
@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is is not cool.
ua3388 @united was cancelled flightled not delayed. re-flight booking problems still 90 miles from home. at least acknowledge the cancelled flightlation.
@united never ever again will i be flight booking problems a flight with united or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a united flight
@united was able to send the dm. all good now.
@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...
@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it is fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
@united - it is been almost 2 weeks and still no word from dot on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end?
@united thanks. got it straightend out last night.
@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
@united any chance flight 3745 is being delayed?? nervous about driving to dfw in this weather to drop off my brother
@united another awful experience and victoria at the check in desk in stl could not have been more rude and condescending.
@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. had to go to sombrons else house
@united have michelle at t1 ordinance train your other staff on how to treat customers. a refreshing pleasure to deal with.
@united i guess you have to follow me in order for me to send you a dm.. i tried and it won't send.
@united will definitely do so. sending a direct message now.
@united stopped flying @united 1 year ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard#notcomingback

@united just sent you a message on facebook how do i follow up a complaint re. missing clothing out of checked baggage?
@united why do i check in online if i still have to wait in line for an hour to check in at counter? #fuckinlame @naia_miaa
@united very poor customer service. i will think again befor flight booking problems another united flight.
@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from los angeles to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
@united hi -- @united was. thank you!
@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. additional friendly and helpful staff
@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your premier groups might be an indication of a broken process.
@united any news about the departure of the flight ua51?
@united ewr agent barbara was fabulous and an example of cust. serv. a pleasure talking to you😊 http://t.co/kmquly9g5e
@united cancelled flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.but it is totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it is cancelled flightled again.
@united changed my last name for my mileageplus account on the site in an hour. @ba_usa had me on hold for 20mins then 5 days &amp; no change yet
@united flight landed 13 hours ago 2 more flights cmh-iad last night and still no bag..could have driven it from cmh
@united someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open bf and gf seats on 919.
@united do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
@united literally sucks
@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! cc: @ciscojimfrench @cobedien
@united maybe be hiring your own ground staff at los angeles when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. hopeless
@united basically i need to leave from hawaii late flight evening (midnight) and get back to philly late flight monday night. most trips get me in tuesday
@united i would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on ual 6166 from buffer to ord. blatantly not stable. uncomfortable.
@united this is the second time my flights been cancelled flightled... like really?
@united really first flt frm iad 2 iah is - late flight &amp; -going via nashville? #inconvenience. downgraded but not on ticket
@united yes please. going to drive the 6 hours.

@united first complaint filed on february 11th over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised....
@united morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. can you get me to newark for my 10am meeting?
@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
@united the child is two years old
@united it is 430am and wife still does not have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way file number: dca48810m #fail
@united was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via dm?
@united followed you and direct messaged you
@united the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.
@united you are terrible.
@united @denairport united 787 in snowy denver. http://t.co/w1aakjumxa
@united i am glad you did not mean to but it does not excuse your inefficiency! only took 70min for the bags we were your only arrival flight
@united i attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. i hope you did not still charge me.
@united … but friendly efficient air attendants in coach #ua992 http://t.co/49pv3kchnr
@united coach interior on ua 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. tiny unusable video no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #ua992 …
@united now about two dozen back in line to see a single csr for reflight booking problems final leg. (kiosks on fritz.)
@united on plane to newark now. i was checked in as rebecca levi. my bag is under her name too.
@united can you help me add my ktn to this reservation plz?
@united aaaand 7 hours late flightr won't be catching a flight til 6am...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
@united whats ua 1205 los angeles - newark ??
@united @delongerry ual sucks
@united not happening. delta took care of us. peace!
but @united just re-booked to bos; uggh!! now 3 hour bus to wmass home. could have flown to bdl &amp; back to dc in same time. #unitedairlines
@united you have now lost my bag. never ever flying united again #joke
@united appreciate it but changing time by 10 minute multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue
@united missed ua1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure ua1543 (uplink prob). i will lose ~$400 in clients mon. how can you compensate?
@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
@united so you jacked out my cousins trip to portland and then cancelled flightled her return trip?! no more united
@united yes i did. we headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after i sent it to you. made it to austin but am now waiting for the luggage.
@united in ethiopia adopting a child. need flight home from add to grr late flight 2/27 or very early 2/28. (need to change existing reservation)
@united after a cancelled flighted flight and 2 delays you lost my luggage again! you're the worst! disgraceful! awful company horrible service!
@united does not help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour late flight.
@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. that's after 9 hour delay.
@united i am very glad i took care of own rescheduling now that ua 1580 from ogg was cancelled flightled. http://t.co/h3k3owohd1
@united tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. how can i tell if it went through? http://t.co/jbdkxd6efz
@united is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac forever?????????
@united one of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
@united that's why i blame your company. because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
@united i wanna be grand staff
@united sf crew lack a lot of customer service los angeles employees are a lot better. wonder why...
@united that's why i missed my flight. if the flight had been held for 5 minutes i would have made it. i watched it pull away from the gate
@united also did not ice the frozen metal walkway. wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the tarmac. did not have a gate agent once we got a gate.
@united i wanna be ride united airline! i love airplane
@united after 2 days - 1 flight cancelled flightled another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. that's how much they value my time??
@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #airlinesecurity
@united what the hell? flight 746. delayed since 3 pm finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane ever leaving?
@united actually the flight was just cancelled flightled! http://t.co/qf0oc2hqez
@united i am a loyal premier platinum member but the lack of communication was really bad. also i don’t see that it has taken off yet
@united thanks for having changed me. managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
@united this is the second time i was rebooked (w/delays) and for reasons unrelate flightd to weather. how do i go about requesting a flight voucher?
@united if you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a sunday night as fast as they can you should reconsider what you think that means.
@united it is the horrible attitude from staff after not just the delay. not the level of service or respect one expects from united
@united why do you want me to be loyal if do not let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
@united ua flight 1247. sfo to los angeles took my carry on at gate. i am group 2 overhead bins are empty
@united on top of that i paid for first class and my wife got stuck in coach.
@united ph the pat answers are bs. after i was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! your employees totally suck.
@united over the last week united has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. disgusting. #united
@united 24 hours since flight landed and zero information on my missing bag? rough estimated time of arrival would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. same fucken issues everything i fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
@united not to belabor my pointbut should not i be able to put a laptop bag above my seat? why is it announced to leave it for rollers? thanks
@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. arrived at los angeles and no gate! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
@united i just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. i can no longer see the status of my equipment?
@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. stranded
@united i am desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this cancelled flightled/delayed flight. #unacceptable #ord
@united nope no more chances. your airline messed up both ways of our trip.
@united why announce it is for rollers at all? if i want to put a coat in there is not that my choice? how about all gate checked? thanks
@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@united bags left behind because plane overweight be great if knew as soon as we landed instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
@united you are a f&amp;$king joke. your customer service is woeful. if your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? no wonder it was a half hour delayed. #oscars
@united worked like a charm. bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and i want to get my hard earn points back total bs
@united does as soon as possible mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@united apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
@united typical caned response from ua fix your crappy performing last placed/ranked airline in this century!
@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
@united customer service is the worst. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
@united was forced to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
@united love how you do not give a shit about people who tried to be loyal but you screw them every way till sunday. glad i have stayed away
@united tried a different flight iah-mnl 4/1/15-4/17/15 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).
@united it will be on a different airline.
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
@united clicked upgrade now and it did not upgrade. what gives? http://t.co/n7osjz8a59
@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still cannot be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
@united tried to book a flight iah-mnl departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that cannot be book!
@united i just booked a flight for (2). when i view my reservation it has mi connected to first name. is this a problem? can it be changed?
@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than eighth place? http://t.co/dewithpew2
@united how do i get through @tsa to finally board ua 1534?
@united yes i have and i was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further but unfortunately i was just bounced around.
@united flight 472 from ordinance could not let me know about this? found out via app minutes before landing. awful flight. http://t.co/dqjl8vz2h2
@united i need help but in spanish
@united a very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one did not wait. no sincere apology just told me to complain online
@united i lost my sunglasses on the flight from okc to iah this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. heh
@united ua1731 - denver to austin... still on the ground...
@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at pvd is failing you big time tonight...
@united ua1469. just landed.
@united considering it. currently gold on @delta. why should i make the jump for an upcoming flight from sfo to singapore?
@united flight 435
@united worst flights i have ever had. ground crew ignored our plane made me miss flight and now i have to cover the cost of a hotel. #den
@united customers are not dumb. these revenue based programs will hurt everyone. not gonna save money like you think
@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. i called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
@united will do. thanks for the help. cheers
@united bull crap. i spent $600 on a recent trip. that's not small change. i got 10000 aa miles. would have only been 6600 ua
@united yes i did. terrible service from your courrier
@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
@united i have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let us make some good memories!
@united we're stuck at ogg looks like flight will be cancelled flightled. can you help? =)
@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. and when time comes no plane second day of work missed #hotelliving
@united currently crying... i wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
@united i tried the online tracking and they said something like attempting to locate luggage
@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in thailand...
@united - going on 3 days (tomorrow) and i still have not received my bag from my flight to toronto. would love to see some seriousness here.
@united is there nothing you can do for me? no compensation at all? given the circumstances i feel like there must be something you can do
@united there is a disconnect between your pr group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground. #liars #united
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments sfo--new york retweet were delayed over 2 hours each! why do you suck so bad!?!maybe another line of bus?
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from maui to san francisco. poor communication bad help in getting connections
@united if you do not like delayed bags why do you let it happen so much?
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people? what about the dis-service you provided for 100+? #flightfail #hour20delay
@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
@united but again united doesnt give 2 shits about their customers
@united its funny how none of your tweets back are helpful what i want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
@united she is travelling from melbourne (australia ) to bogota (colombia) tomorrow
@united hi. my relative's flight booking problems number is my8yb4. her name is clarita jaramillo mejia. thank you
@united it was delivered! thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
@united really needs to get its act together. really disappointed in our change of flight delayed flights etcetera.
@united-rebooked to oma - 180 miles from my destination. spotty customer service. i get staff stressors but come on this is your business.
@united why have airlines always told us they cannot open a cabin door once it has been closed? this plane has done it 3 times tonight.
“@united: looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/gguig3t28z”
@united i cannot find any late flight evening flights. are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
@united thanks for the vague canned response that does not address the issue!
@united thank you!
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
@united otis in the baggage claim by bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
@united why is my time less important to you? #strandusindenver #hourandtenminutedelay #flightfail
@united airlines: you kidding? bagage lost this morning from ny to washington and still no trace? #badservice
@united i did. it took about an hour and a half though
@united why have you never held a plane for me? #hourdelay #multipledooropeningandclosing #dangerofgettingsnowedin
@united i did but i got nothing from it. just dissapointment =(
@united where is my fucking bag?!?! where the fuck is my fucking bag??? tell me now or give me a number to call a human. san68059m
@united i was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other cancelled flightlations.
@united made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they would not let us on. http://t.co/xatoxbnsfa
@united time to give up my 1k status and switch to @delta - you are so terrible i cannot even describe.
@united thanks! lol! #ua6259 will wait for us. per @flightaware same tail number as #ua5525 :)
@united you suck. flight delayed equipment probs again. miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it is at the gate.
@united #1758 now going in 40 minute waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
@united flight 2 is 2:30 hours delayed so far b/c of late flight crew. now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
@united many people on ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in sfo tarmac. seriously you cannot find an empty gate?
@united you're trying to solve problem of your own making. charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. brilliant.
@united we've been waiting 45 minute for a gate at sfo... yet so many of them are free. your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
@united delayed due to customer service huh? http://t.co/xltv5z6st1
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at kansas kci?!? that's it???
@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
@united maybe find a different gate #ua1758
@united i sent a message. it is very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. this is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
@united landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
@united wanted to point out that not one united crew has been sympathetic. questions unanswered. mileageplus is starting to look like a joke
@united can we get an explanation on why ua978 from são paulo to houston has been delayed? now we're hearing from crew about cancelled flightlations.
@united why was flight 1180 ewr to mco cancelled flightled for tomorrow and what do i do to rebook. asking for a relative.
@united can you tell me jet airways award availability?
@united i understand the intent was not to inconvenience but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes was not an option.
@united what are the chances of my flight to ewr from pit being cancelled flighted tomorrow?
@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
@united wife landed in dc 5hrs ago. luggage did not was told it would b delivered/hotel by 8pm. it is now 10pm no luggage. #ua484
@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat cannot use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86kihge
@united is so cheap they could not afford to run the ac on #ua1510. they took pressure cooker to a new level. #cheap #worstairline
@united why is it that sundays when my husband travels to chicago he is stuck at tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
@united well i can tell you that your customer service at rdu airport is horrific but is exception at o'hare in chicago.
@united sitting on ual 683 - a comedy of errors. ual is incompetent
@united on #ua3785 tonight and told delayed due to late flight crew. no idea where crew coming from your staff ++unhelpful. any ideas?
@united take a look at status of 683 sitting at ordinance ... this ain't cool yo.
@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
@united i did not have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and was not going to pay for another cab to do so.
@united did not realize my bag/ contents were wet until i got to my hotel. sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. mtgs start tomorrow.
@united you load our plane at ordinance knowing pilots are 2 hours late flight then discover plane needs to be fueled? #wtf #united #incompetent
@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. i want my refund and i would like to speak to someone about it.
@united i am really glad i just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. your customer service sucks. nothing has been
@united you just caused a riot on the airplane. never seen anything like this
@united instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 minute just say we will get you there when we get you there.
@united so glad i have been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. worst service ever.
@united we still need help. hung up on twice. customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
@united they let us know in advance of the reboot yes :) thanks for the attentiveness!
@united laugh out loud too little too late flight
@united yes. bags came 1 hr after i arrived at baggage claim. awful experience on the ground at bhm
@united @fernheinig18 your delay is due to your own making. we have now been back to the gate multiple times. maybe take accountability
@united why do i have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin? please start charging. http://t.co/2ny5tuxfqf
@united please tell clt flight 4232 needs a gate. waiting now for 15 mins.
@united why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours late flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
@united booked ewr-fll in first for two on 3-8. let us see how you compare to the garbage @americanair first class has become
@united your seats are god awful.
@united good try but @southwestair got her here safer and sooner
@united wanted to compliment your phone agent jeanette for reflight booking problems rdu to sea through sfo after connecting flight through ewr was cancelled flightled.
@united 3 hour 45 minute delay so far..... would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
@united educate bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. i can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...i cannot do both. can you help?
@united i need to get from albuquerque nm usa to cebu philippines. i am providing educational help for 800 kids. can you help me?
@united i am on ua1118 and my direct tv is not working. how do i avoid this in future?
@united is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. do not believe gate agent that overhead is full; do not reserve aisle http://t.co/cdzhtyd0ak
@united i sure will
@united on the plane. i was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are probably others that also deserved it
@united any options to cos tonight? does not look like #ua5525 will make it in time for #ua6259. should i reserve a hotel room?
@united appreciated but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. fax...like in the 80s.
@united s/o to @delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home 🙌🙌
@united customer service sucks! they hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
@united jp - direct message message who? cannot get a direct message through to @united
@united strikes again! why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? common sense.
@united: thanks for the miserable trip gnv&lt;&lt;&lt;fsd on 2.19-2.21.
@united missed ktm flight due to your cancelled flightlation. mike supervisor disgusting. now day late flight. no apology or upgrade offer to lhr from ord???
@united left my ipad on mco-&gt;iad flight 174. how long to hear back once claim submitted? ty!
@united social media team is on point on #oscarnight :)
@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to maintenece and it would appear incompetence
@united is the airline of the oscars but does not carry abc on direct tv?!?! fail - now i cannot watch the oscars. #united
@united this is it... last time i fly #unitedairlines you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ordinance and miss work.
@united did not know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! very interesting.
@united i understand the intention but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and i because of the delay.
@united i need help with a missing bag.
@united i was. but i have given up.
@united can i get on a stand by list from ase to ord? i am the only poor person in aspen that's why i am asking for standby on twitter.
@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now i will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. help!
@united ua647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if your packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for late flight passengers
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. neverflyunited
@united hey so many time changes for ua 1534. we going tonight or what? mia - ewr
@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to hayden/steamboat (hdn) from denver. so i am hoping its on there
@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. when i went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
@united i honestly could not tell you. all i know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and i get that. just wish it was handled better
@united ua1534 has now had 11 different departure times. wtf. make up your mind.
@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
@united thank you for following up!
@united claudia in iah terminal b travel assistance has me all set. great service. thank you.
@united is it possible to add a known traveler number to my ticket after flight booking problems?
@united why does not my daughter booked with my gold member miles get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?

@united no thanks
@united cdg-las 42 hours. and my luggage is in sfo. i have been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
@united why do you hate your passengers?
@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. does not anyone actually do maintenance
.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
@united is my flight delayed? it keeps changing between delayed and not??? if delayed is checkin time late flightr??? http://t.co/ntuix5dbyr
@united what a long day of delays. please get us to dallas tonight!!!! fingers crossed!!! #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
@united -how is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? almost missed my flight this morning. not cool!
@united they had record of it being at denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. i just want to confirm its location
@united #lax #sunrise ual212 lax-jfk
@united ...would be on the next flight to hayden/steamboat
@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. the united customer service people said the bag would be on
@united there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me.
@united late flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service and your agents not all are as arrogant as ever. #unitedairlines
@united denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #den
@united flight 3870 to newark stuck in the runway. about to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!
@united false.
@united sitting on the runway in newark they won't let the plane to a gate. my connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
@united thanks it was my first time in a united lounge and felt welcomed.
.@united all other ana ticket holders get to use the lounge too. but not us. because united booked us. #grumpykim
@united good evening ua. can you assist with an issue via dm?
@united never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. and more delays at @flylaxairport. great job idiots.
@united 100. % failure in 2015 #unitedairlines
@united can cancelled flight my flight anytime if this is where they keep me for the night.. http://t.co/avrtowtyzk
@united you guys suck 2 1/2 delay to get out of ers and did not even have curtesy to let me know #unitedairlines
@united unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on saturday. inpolite crew bad delays.
@united seriously? 45 minute on the plane at bhm and now 30 minute in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever
@united thanks for updating me about the 1+ hour delay the exact second i got to atl. 🙅🙅🙅
@united but we are on all nippon now (booked by united to replace the one we missed).
@united what is this subtlety gate changes? are you kidding with me?
@united been good 15yr friendly skies relationship. 2day agent told me i am only canadian and thus not good enough for military preboard
@united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. now there are no available spots
“@united: @rikrik__ what made you come to this? can we help you with anything? ^jp” inconvience*
“@united: @rikrik__ what made you come to this? can we help you with anything? ^jp” free tickets for the i convince .
“@united: @rikrik__ what made you come to this? can we help you with anything? ^jp” the service just has not been great.
.@united i think not. i am not flying you again if i can help it.
@united resolved. over hour of work on ground &amp; somehow the system reset itself during takeoff. i appreciate the quick response/service.
@united always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwayslate flight #worstairlineever
@united we were told when we checked in as soon as we were allowed to that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle.
@united everytime i fly your airline i hate you even more ! thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
.@united really? was bumped down from gold status asked to pay $$ to keep it and get fewer miles... how is that worth it?
@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. you guys suck. #worst
@united that i would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for otis i would be still sitting at ordinance
@united and to add to my earlier tweet. this was my daughters fifth bday present. thank you for the hard work and making it happen.
@united you have a guy named otis at ordinance that knows what #customerservice is. he was able to get my bag to me. i upgraded just to be sure
@united @lpdstock tweet bots obviously do not get sarcasm making computers more and more like real people.
@united you all do a wonderful job today. got my wife daughter and myself from pgh to orlando after out flight was delayed luggage and all
@united customer service what's that???
@united -- overflight booking problems planes departing delayed returning for 'more quick fixes' &amp; breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline
@united pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. second time this has happened!!
@united that's what you have said for years you are losing customers!!!!!!
@united i am ua elite gold and have a ua chase pres. plus credit card. how many eqm's do i need to get platinum elite!
@united. once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
@united now this http://t.co/uygew2nosr
@united would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that do not provide full pqm credit are more obvious before purchase. lost 1200 miles
@united nope. even better there were 4 seats. and due to w&amp;b first to raise hands got to move up. i was not fast enough.
@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
@united look at this beauty 😉 dc-10 united airlines 😉 hope you like this beauty 😉 http://t.co/ns1acfqcdq
@united seriously what's with the slow #wifi on this flight! if the speed was going to change for the worse then the price should not go up!
. @united 5 hours 3 gates and 3 planes late flightr still not an update explanation or apology to be had. #worstairlineever #unitedairlines
@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!
@united poor cabin luggage service on ua1266 to bos i was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!
@united when i click that link it wants my flight info. i have not booked a flight yet. i read you waive fees for military it this true?
@united no we still have not heard anything from anyone at @united or the @erieairport
@united every time i search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. about to book on a different airline and cancelled flight my card.
@united so the last segment of my flight from denver (den) to hayden/steamboat (hdn) for 8am got cancelled flightled and i need help finding my luggage
@united 8 hours late flightr and i am siting on another plane waiting to leave. i think a credit is in order for this terrible service!
@united i will let you know week after next when i do another coast-coast retweet again.
@united we waited 40 minute for our bags after a 45 minute flight #nomorecheckedbags
@united now let there also please be in-flight live tv on ua469 den-ewr so i can watch the #oscars ??
@united​ has cancelled flighted 1 arrival into shv tonight &amp; the first departure flight on monday february 23rd. check with your airline for flight status.
@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on ua5168 (most) /ua795 were beyond exceptional today. #givethoseladiesraise
@united 4 open seats in first class on ua 2065. way to honor your upgrade policy for frequently flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade.
@united i trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
@united yes i have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.this has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
@united of course. but interesting how united does not seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reflight booking problems not an option unfortunately.
@united finally made it to rep who solved my problem.
@united you guys are complete ass
@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire seau fong for helping me get re-booked out of boise and (hopefully) home to new york city sometime tonight!
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #ua1481. we have all wasted an entire day at stt.
@united thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
@united you friend's flt from ase to denver is cancelled flightled for tomorrow. can you help with rebook?
@united - plane came in with broken seat. rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on atc?! i watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min late flight
@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...i often did...interesting to me #tcmparty #ce3k #31daysofoscar
@united went to customer service kiosk and they were able to help out! still thanks for following up!
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
@united your b737-800w literally the smallest seats i have ever have my dad got stuck in the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k
@united and we got zero vouchers for hotel or cab. i expect some serious mileage credits.
@united nope all set. thanks for checking.
@united +the plane.
@united my flight was already cancelled flightled this morning because of a snow storm in denver. and now i am in dc waiting for a pilot to get on+
@united still sucks. i do not understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at houston international b gate #unitedsucks
@united the most frustrating flying experience. one continuous i dunno what time you will leave today. . dunno?! that's code for ...?
@united on 2/20 denver ap gate b91 (destination santa fe) agent ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. kudos.
@united has an united flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
@united i would rather spend two days in the back seat of a volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
@united my flight was supposed to depart to boston at 4:36 and now it is departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. thanks a lot!!
@united i suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. not my problem if someone complains!
@united you could give me free flights for life and i would still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor.
@united the first time i flew united was horrible thought i would give you a second chance. there will not be a third! #disgruntled
@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
@united 4994 out of jackson wyoming... delayed by no pilots.. full toilets.. deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. cancelled flightled flight pending
@united is by far the worst airline i have ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries i have flown to!!! it is outrageous!
@united ... i want my bag off flight 1142 what do i do now?
@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
@united i do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. can you please guide me. thanks
@united i hope you lose the next government contract
@united lost my bags and there was a flight from chi to eri that landed over 1.5 hours ago...yet still have zero updates?? #unitedairlinessux
@united i will just send my confirmation number when i get home safe and sound. this is why i pay so expensive services to you!
@united the bag is in a state that i did not travel to and the airports do not fly to each other. looks like it'll never show
@united ridiculous! i have to be refunded whenever i get at my final destination or not!
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
@united seriously? ua 806. delayed because of the copilot is not here? for 1.5 hours and he is only flying from raleigh? disappointing
@united seriously. this is just complete bs.
@united we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?
@united the costumer services here at denver intl airport is ridiculous bad!
@united lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
@united i have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
@united ouch not fair
@united is synonymous to with #rude. and #cheap. you really do not know how to value the customer
@united i have to go back home! i have to use what the company has available. but it is unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
@united if i miss the #oscars i will never fly united again
@united is the stingiest airline. nobody should model after them. #ptfo #cheap #bastards #stingy
@united flight delayed...again...every time. maintenance issues
@united i should be fine. they automatically changed my connecting flight for me so i would not miss it. a+ work.
@united yes... a ride home would be perfect.. a fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... psalms we deplaned
@united i will be calling tomorrow
@united and i was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that cannot get their tiny tvs to work!
@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for cancelled flighting my international flight yesterday but i did not get an email.
@united maybe do not play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi is not working...✈️
@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. no meaningful information.
@united...do you still have flat tire policy. shuttle broke down on way to ord. will probably miss the 425pm to cle...help please!!
@united thanks. just was able to do it on the app myself. still not customer service to be seen in yyz
@united thanks off the response finally got through the 45 minute wait and talked to someone.
@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vbfieo2qjc
@united i would take the $500 voucher you offered for miscounting the # of seats on your plane but that means i would have to fly you again
@united - 3 of 6 first seats open on ua5097. no upgrades processed. gate agents @yyz said their too busy. not cool http://t.co/6kpyhcka9l
@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of chicago flight is late flight and no announcement has been made
@united i believe. it was cancelled flighted yesterday i guess. goes back to no notification from united about cancelled flightlation
@united - in case you're reading this ua230 right now 7d. so many oversized carryons taking up too much room. enforce your rules.
@united is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight there's no overhead space.
@united okay just requested to follow.
@united thanks just dm'd. confession #'s mqxc64 &amp; mpwnc2. any help appreciated
@united make sure you take care of @lsusoftball team &amp; @lsuquinlanduhon team. we are 16-0!!!!
@united delayed 7 hours flight 5721 pit/iad finally board the plane sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hours limit &amp; we deplane. unacceptable.
@united stuck in yyz because staff took a break? not happy 1k....
@united personal device entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins i am glad it is free for now.
@united please stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-it's been 3hrs. i usually defend you but this is lame..
@united agent you should use the bathroom before boarding.. toilets onboard are full. oh you can expected a strongly worded email funited
@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? i would rather just fly another airline thanks.
@united united flight ua3774 after two delays just cancelled flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to norfolk that are not booked. renting a car.
@united i will try it. mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
@united any way you can help me find a flight to las? stuck in dia sat on plane 2 hours now been waiting an hour for an update.
@united 50 minute wait times to help with a cancelled flightled flight?? help a guy out?
@united i was rebooked but had to take bus from portland maine to boston. told united does not cover the charge.
@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight?
@united you were doing so well until the phl-sfo flight yesterday. major miss. unfriendly premier cabin crew. baggage cluster at sfo.
@united your baggage tracking system is worthless! it tells me nothing about where the bag is much less what your plans are to get it to me
@united is offering to reroute my sfo flight to lax. might be geography class time.
@united thank you for letting me down.my luggage is still in denver but i am in phl. #neveragain #flyingwithus #disappointed #lostacustomer
@united can you get me on the delayed flight to ewr out of yyz at 15:30? no customer service to be found in airport

@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights and all but stranding me in houston tonight. airlines are the absolute worst
@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. unacceptable
@united missing my amazing us bank work conference not ok. what do i do now?????

@united has terrible customer service &amp; does not feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
@united i have tried and you have failed. still no wifi ever last row in the middle and i fly every week. thanks for nothing.
@united great flight into pvd. smallest plane i have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?

“@united:that's not something we like to hear. hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way asap. ^ml”:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
@united you must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
@united i do not know what direct message the confirmation number means.
@united waiting for 3494 ewr-ord delayed 47 mins. might miss 5491 ord-ywg at 6pm ct. any room on 5644 ord-ywg in case i miss connex?
@united what does direct message the confirmation @ mean???
@united - well now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. well over an hour delay!!
@united i missed my connection already. then i missed the next flight they put me on. now i am going to los angeles instead of hawaii. :(
@united reservation was made last july. i want to know why i was not reseated. this only happens on international itineraries
@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems late flightr i do not have time.
@united american never had my bags apparently. united never switched them over. had to go back to united baggage service.
@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 minute late flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to tucson left before we even landed
@united cmh gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked no volunteers no boarding 20 minute late flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff
@united waiting half an hour for my checked bag at ewr (&amp; that was priority); disappointing usually you guys are good.
@united are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on tarmac loading bags? january
@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat i did not want all while not even notifying me. great 1k service 👎
@united you guys are gay
@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the cancelled flightlation yesterday

@united it would make my day if i could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. train your employees to communicate
@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit what are you going to do about this?
@united you cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. no empathy from gate staff or crew no apology. really?
@united rescheduled my return flight from #japan? uh why? trying to call #unitedairlines #customerservice - 45 minute wait. #fun
@united is by far the worst airline ever 😡😡
@united no. re-booked with american and united said they'd transfer our bags to them.
@united i am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 ewr to bos. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
@united i am dming my information and no is assisting. my flight home left before m first flight had even landed
@united boston is all self service. swipe year own boarding pass at gate. most difficult: tag your own bag. not easy! #improvetheprocess
@united name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. first name and mi run together. cause for concern?
@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
@united no consistency #denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing faa. your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch
only 14 business days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ? i hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #badcustomerservice
@united thanks but why did this occur? you guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. so that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
@united so many delays today...what's up with that? hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #united #premier1k
@united your website is fucked up. now instead of a $416 flight i should’ve had yesterday it’s $514 today. thanks.
@united called back and i have been on hold. what is the issue?! i have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much i have paid
@united i am not sure how you can help. your flight experience is terrible planes are dirty and staff is rude. start over perhaps?
@united check in and it is still saying i have not paid. i have called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. i
@united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. i tried to

@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. at these fares united should have top notch service
@united direct messages not going through please help
@united why not charge for second carryon instead of checked bag? less jockeying for overhead space happier passengers more ontime departures
@united adding reservation to ios app does not show up on desktop site when logged in. and miles cannot be redeemed for upgrades through your app
@united i assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by united? what's worse is plane is here but crew cannot fly!!

@united so what's the solution?
@united is screwing with my flights again at cae? why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get cancelled flighted?
@united no. i need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
@united so this did not work out at all!! incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over twitter @theairhelper
@united we got it thanks.
@united the so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from houston to norway. shoulder shrugging is all you do..
@united this is probably the least dependable airline in the western hemisphere. @united does not belong in star alliance but skyteam
@united severely under staffed at iah.
@united amazing hospitality and helpfulness from anthony lastella. great staff 👏👏👏✈️ definitely flying #united again.
@united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
@united just touched down in miami - not too far off nicely done united 👍

@united not for me. i am on another ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
@united can you assign seats
“@united: @4geiger it looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. is this correct? ^jh” always blame the customer

@united thank you!
@united who authors this fiction? i just heard on radio we do not even have a jetway secured yet #ua5037 #cmh http://t.co/t78k7abtwf
@united so? found anything or just showing off? you do realise that the morning flight that you cancelled flightled was more pricey than the evening?
@united oh i did. was still lost. your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. unitedfail
@united please follow for dm.
@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. inexcusable
@united i sent you a direct message as requested but have not heard anything. can you address the issue i brought up in my direct message and explain what happened?
@united employee=faceless. do not throw them under the bus. starts with management. i am almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
@united you cannot say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding has not even started! http://t.co/2ikbp8gxwi
@united i understand that but why should i pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. if it was weather i would understand
@united 30 hours late flightr still no answers stuck in houston. keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #badcustomerservice
@united you guys are horrible! first we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. our flight was delayed then cancelled flightled then delayed again. 32 hours and counting
@united direct messaged you 4 hours ago at your request. no response to be found .... just like my bag.
@united worked out after all. thanks for your immediate reply!!
@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. so far terrible customer service. #neveragain
@united it was 3387. but we helped you with the weight issue took your vouchers and hopped on a @delta flight instead. #winwin
@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay was not enuf you charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. get your shit together
@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. another flight last week was cancelled flighted. your track record is the worst!
@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
@united can you put russell daiber (on same ticket) as well into premium eco? appreciated!
@united can you get me to okc from sacramento today. dfw is now closed
@united any chance you could help rebook?? my flight cancelled flightled
@united out of curiosity when a flight is arranged are pilots notified? there are a lot of pilots have not arrived yet announcements.
@united yes. to boston. i was going to providence.
@united you really need a better system for handling cancelled flightled flights http://t.co/3ubcoasyws
@united how are conditions in bos today? i am in ua994. everything appears to be in time but i wanted to check.
@united same day flights
@united it is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on late flightr
@united give me a direct number i can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and cannot guarantee them another flight for three days!
@united please follow faa guidelines regarding bumping. it is not acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've
@united i did already rebook and now i will miss my first appointments in london tomorrow morning. thanks for ruining my trip - again!
.@united our newest delay right now http://t.co/96ftlzwtvo
@united. if you show available seats you need to honor that! i shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that really there are 3 not 4 seats
@united 50 minute on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out. agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
@united is a joke. lots of angry people at iah this am.
@united i6ep18
@united completely unacceptable to seat first class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
@united found flight after 2.5 hrs. how am i offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hours before lose my seat out of neglect then get nothing?
@united dm'ed you
@united nicole at quito airport took great care of us this week. handled lost baggage seat changes. very professional/nice. pat her back.
@united why de-ice before taxing? maybe it #makestoomuchsense ? #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks @delta @southwestair @americanair
@united flight 1547 cmh to ordinance just arrived at gate. next segment to yvr already boarding. will they hold it?
@united right as we think we will take off we stop to get de-iced. why was not this done when the planes were sitting out all night?
@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on us air today. three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
@united delayed more and more these days. mco &gt; iad. fingers crossed i make my connection home to albany. #united1k

@united : flight delayed by 24 hours lost my wallet have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks
@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. we could have driven to florida from pa quicker both ways! worst trip ever!
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
@united apparently sleeping in b terminal was not the worst situation. someone told other ua passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
@united why do not you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? or we could just delay :/
@united fuck you for not caring 😢
@united its been five days i am just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. i do not want to have to take this higher up.
@united question. are departure times based off eastern central time or the time zone your actually in?
very quick! ty. @united: @auciello i am sorry to hear this. can you please follow and direct message me the details of what transpired? ^jh
@united if you lost my belongings then be honest!

@united if united loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
@united was on nh10 on united ticket rerouted to iad due to weather in jfk. can you get us home on united 5713 or 3277?
@united thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. not only will i now arrive 5 hours late flight to my destination but...
@united do not fly united with checked baggage! it will never find you!
@united why cannot you have an english/spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
@united why would you overnight my bag wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently cannot contact!
@united hey thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks
@united i have never been more frustrated than my conversations with united who cannot speak spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
@united i have never been mislead by a company as many times as i have this week by united airlines!
@united i would never fly united airlines again!
@united i am still in the airport waiting for my flight.

@united i am - thank you!

@united it is too late flight for reflight booking problems now - it is morning already and i no longer need a hotel room
@united once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. do you actually care about customers or just making money?
sorry @united. i accidentally populate flightd with you instead of @usairways. cannot wait 'til you are the only you in the sky. #newamericanstinks
@united you have cancelled flightled my flight ua922 for aircrft maintenance. i am delayed 10 hours now. what's my refund options?

@united this has been the worst flight experience i have ever had. thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
@united thanks for the epic service on 863- always a pleasure- outstanding crew http://t.co/trqlpeinzw
@united hey it is 4am guess what i am doing? not sleeping! why? cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports
@united no my concerns were not addressed
@united duh and done. bag whereabouts unknown. greeeaat
@united thanks for letting me sleep at dia to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. wait no fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks
@united oh i will be sharing alright. especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because ua.
@united @maxabrahms *if* he needs assistance? do you expect him to go on a scooby doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
thanks @united for writing back. to assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. too much to ask?
@united you hung up on me again.
@united your customer service team in manilla is absolute shit. i cannot even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!
@united it is disgusting and unconscionable the treatment i have received tonight.
@united of course i would like hepl! are you kidding me? that's the only reason i have been on hold for the past 5 hours!
@united @thisiscoach every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
@united you've got to be kidding me. i still have not talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! and asking for a follow????
.@united i would not describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. to help you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it.
@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
@united is that all that matters not the fact that we're at a different destination we were put through a tremendous amount of stress
@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag gee thnx. ua922 awesome job
@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. is not there anyone actively monitoring your cust serve? this is unreal!!
@united nice. i wonder how you pick who to respond to? maybe only happy customers are easier. i wonder how many of those you have left.
@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? i have gotten no help from you tonight.
@united thanks for nothing. really?!? 60 minute wait times when i have had to call back 4x. that's 240minute wait times.
@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. abysmal. i have been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. hung up on by year people 3x.
@united you can read the full story when i submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in dia
@united what's with the layover in canada from the ua125? is that scheduled?
@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the faa would not let him fly is negligence.
@united i bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now i got an email that indicates united cancelled flightled my ticket! why?
@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. entertainment: non existent. new seats: seriously uncomfortable. really? #unitedfail ua1550
@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from los angeles to chicago. what a mess! you can do better!
@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #appreciation link better be giving out #goldentickets
@united where is our luggage
@united we just left @flysfo (delayed). http://t.co/xzbajmiekx
@united all set. figured it out at the baggage office!
@united screws up again...to be expected! never again!
@united why do not you allow families with small children to board first anymore? our next flight will be on another airline...
@united life goal: complete ✔️
@united i have $20 and i will draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. will that get me round-trip to san diego? 🌴🌴 it is so cold here.
@united flight cancelled flightled to denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to denver or red eye out of atlanta then hung up on me.
@united that's called throwing loyalty out the window and trying to give less awards.
@united your unhelpful team? sure i did. i am in bangkok my bag in chicago. are you going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??
@united i would hardly call going from 10000 miles to 1000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. about 1/10 the perk?
@united that's not an apology. say it.
@united just sent a dm. thank you for the acknowledgment.
@united download jeokoo the american app for air travelers
@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a cancelled flighted flight tomorrow morning. what do you suggest?
@united no apology? cool.
@united you ask a lot of customers who you routinely screw over. you know that right?
@united i am a first time solo female traveller and it is pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
@united i am. who knows where my bags are. do i just wait around and hope they arrive? no one has answers i have plans and no answers....
@united somehow i knew that you'd wait until i was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
@united missing flight attendant = delayed flight. prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. hnl -&gt; iah (ua252) #wastedtime
@united has me stranded in texas and then hangs up on me when i am trying to figure out how to get home. cool.
@united we have tried to change our flight three times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
@united poor showing today no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage
@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how wifi is coming! hah.not before i leave. @virginamerica ftw
@united can i get a follow? i fly with you for christmas.
@united more people stranded cause you suck. better yet you weasel out of flight booking problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/flcnnn2usd
@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they could not fly 6232 to jac. http://t.co/6kp4m0r1f7
@united thank you! much appreciation for your help.
@united been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in newark. first no gate then no jetway operator. seriously!?
@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at ewr tonight. flight 354 disappointed
@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting for over 1 hr
@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96xc3bo
@united - routing a person from houston to newark nj and then to sfo is not acceptable.
@united phone
@united freakin

@united i am following - you need to follow me for dm?
@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
@united not a good day to fly you two delayed flights still on plane at ewr waiting over 15 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent.
@united just called and did it. should have earlier because i am being sent to dca first and then to pvd. we may rent a car instead.
@united my luggage is set to go to dca however i am rerouted to dulles. currently in nolo however bags are in houston. can you fix this?
@united i went from sacramento to minneapolis at the end of october 2014 in business class.
@united i am extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #united #mileageplus explorer card holder.
@united i hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #unitedairlinessucks
@united such a relaxing space for a drink before my flight! (at @united global first lounge) https://t.co/j4cj0lrf2d http://t.co/dtlguq1kak
@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou
@united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. terrible customer experience

@united do you expect to cancelled flight flights out of @denairport tomorrow morning given the storm?
@united also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
@united i have a question
@united can you increase the legroom? : how airlines compare http://t.co/diufep8n2q via @cnnmoney
@united on a 4 segment flt yvr to zurich why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?
@united i see two flights with two seats in the morning can we get on those
@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and i see 2 right there. #unitedlies
@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight ua936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
@united sitting in denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. for an hour and a half! hurry the fuck up united you fucking retards
@united we will be at the airport first thing in the morning
@united i am rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though i had first class seat origination i have a lousy coach seat
@united well this one missed the mark. she was in a snit from the minute i stepped up to the counter
@united does not have to be same flight 2 and 2 will work also
@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you do not have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight ua936 at #iad delayed. we've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
@united please get me off this plane #ua57
@united yes. on a nonstop to memphis tomorrow morning. with the snow coming in i got my fingers crossed it will go.
@united traveling with 3 young kids!! chose our original flights for a reason.
@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
@united your app says flight ua936 to #zrh departed 2:45hrs late flight but 5 hours late flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #iad. #failed
@united not completely. our flight was changed in july but we never received notification.
@united are there any upgrades available to get us all on the same flight
@united wife and i have two new destinations and i am stuck in dc until monday with no bags
@united no i don't. spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. said they will try to get bags to stay at iad for pick up tmrw
@united can you make sure i’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 ewr-pdx using my gpu priority? got a weird email about it.
@united so is that two seats available so far for us.
@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
@united is flight number 1142 denver to las vegas 1125 on sunday february 22 cancelled flighted ?
@united when i read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me when for example would it not be the case?
@united i am trying your wifi on ua1616. but sorry it really slow. even #spotify lagging and that is not a hard stream.
@united not until tomorrow night. and the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity not loving cost but hard working staff
@united flight ua1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate seriously??? #threehourslate flight
@united why do not you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? because of this i never get to use the #tsa prescreen i paid for
@united boarding was decent 3 useless agents that do not speak english (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mechanical delay not so much
@united after all i have been through on this trip can you get me on another airline home?
@united flight was cancelled flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #makessense #efficiency #travel #flying
@united it is 9:56 and the desk attendant stated we would sit awhile until given the all clear. lack of communication seems to the norm.
@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. hopefully i will never have to fly @united ever again ..
@united i would really like to get off of this plane now.
@united possibly the worst airlinegave them three chances second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or cancelled flightled due to mechanics
@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. flight 1109 landed in washington because of it. my head is pounding.
@united sandra at your international checkin counter was rude and offensive. she commented she did not care if i complained cuz she had 25yrs
@united my contact stuff is in the bag and i am legally blind. this is so messed up.
@united did i mention that i was on the plane so is my luggage. my luggage that i am not going to have for how many days.
@united 3 times i have called customer services each at least 40 mins... each time cut off by your operators... why cannot you call me back!
@united tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
@united omg!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. can this get any worse.
@united which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
@united yeah i tried that about 10 times for two different tickets and it told me to try again late flightr.
@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. he single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
@united you blow
@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/zhxok07aqa
@united - flight cancelled flightled. 4 hours at airport to book a new one for $95. just got two invoices for the flight each for approximately $300. really?!
@united why do you hire positive pilots? thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
.@united your airline is again rated the worst in america so you've got your work cut out for you. it is bc you treat customers like garbage.
@united what's the best way to get your tickets? print off at home or go to check in desk?
@united pay for my hotel.... i am a broke student #help
@united all 4 of us are on standby in houston tomorrow for flights to calgary. if you could get us on one or two of those that would help
@united what a nightmare!! both sides of my flights are a disaster! at houston getting attitude cuz i was sent to ticket counter
@united you're terrible.
@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. will be sent on. but i won't be for days!
@united anyone there? did you read my dm?
@united 732 from denver. we just boarded! fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
@united ewr to mco made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. worst pain i have ever felt i thought i was going to pass out
@united how does that make a flight takeoff on time? and regardless it makes me late flight because now i have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
@united it is been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @foxnews @cnn @msnbc
@united trying to get a customer service agent. just landed in sfo. cannot fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
@united why are there no early morning flights from hnl to anywhere in the continental us? example- monday 4/20. need flight to phl
@united nope i gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
@united thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
@united more and more delays! no cs help at all! no notifications!
@united and waiting
@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow! have a ship to board! the schedule aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
@united husband made it by the skin of his teeth! :)
@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
@united first you delay my flight for mechanical failurethen 2 hours on the runway &amp; 13 hours late flightr i am still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution
@united is the worst
@united still waiting

@united i have requested upgrade for ewr bom flight end of may. miles + copay. when will i know if i am upgraded?
@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
@united #customerservice at @dulles_airport could not be worse. i get the bad weather but this is awful.
@united any plans of restating nonstop service between iad and south florida? we miss our flights to fll.
@united instead of be told when we board we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays.
@united additionally my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight.
@united following
@united unfortunately they didn't. i asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask people in our row to switch but no one would
@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been cancelled flightled

@united 4595. we are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.love united but this stinks
@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says i was definitely on the flight!
@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from lga to ewr has electrical power outlets but our new airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
reply to @united - does not do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
@united 15-hr flight w/broken #dreamliner media system. witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. remind me why i am 1k.
@united i was rebooked through sfo but arrive 9 hours late flight and miss activities. i asked to fly today with stop over. was told i would have to pay.
@united never again.
@united tonight you made this fred flintstone happy with an upgrade to first class. http://t.co/gkgkzlawpr
@united who do i need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on united?
@united is trying to strand us in houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overflight booking problems and maintenance are not our fault.
@united your costumer service today in the providence airport was sucked. recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
@united fire year rep who refused to put me on a flight that i had a boarding pass and seat on. full explanation and her name in complaint.
@united that's great! please let me know when you start!
@united @ehsanismpowered lmfao
@united god damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40 so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit.
@united you really do have a culture problem. everyone i tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
@united sucks.
@united i can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. phoenix?
@united is honestly ruining my fucking life right now. never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@united flight cancelled flightled to bdl and stranded @dulles_airport. waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. shout out to diligent agents.
@united where's the crew for ua748?
@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but i am at the gate with a seat assignment. super nice agent at gate c4 ordinance
@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbo5dakak
@united no customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. ruined 2 events i had today. #disappointed
@united we've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. it is no coincidence your ranked worst airline.
@united yes after landing at 930pm last night. spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.
@united charging $6500 for business flight to uk = somewhat egregious. charging $3 on top for a sam adams draft at the united club is usurious.
@united i see. thanks for explaining.
@united your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
@united if you follow me i will direct message you my phone # which you can call.
@united after an hour+ wait my issue is resolved. i did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. thanks for contacting me.
@united yes they did. must have fixed the broken ramp. thanks!
@united flight:ua1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ sfo 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y i hate this airline

@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it is beyond repair. i am beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
@united the opal dragon book the dragon (ali) has woven his murdering ways from the philippines to australia http://t.co/n2fvelcygz
@united a friend traveled via ua1470 today and never got their luggage. what recourse does the person have? buy clothes and get reimbursed?

@united just filled it out. hope someone responds before we book our next trip.
@united friends been sitting in houston since 7am flight cancelled flighted.still do not have any answers. #badcustomerservice #$10voucherwhatajoke
@united meant changed planes - i hate seating over wing if you wanted i would have booked it - you will get formal complaint

@united you guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so i had to i have even though i have platinum and the other person none
@united also checked email you have on file for me and it is correct
@united haven’t before and haven’t this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in case—nothing
@united sloppy stuff you do not see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
@united no bag tagging led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags
@united cabin crew were huge offenders stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers
@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
@united no wheelchairs
@united no commitment to a good turnaround an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance
@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/tsvgbrl15f
@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround
@united as a million miler with ua and flying almost every week i observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations
@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
@united thanks we did.
@united yes i have been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me.
@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. we will fly with you again! #unitedairlines
@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! it is ridiculous!!
@united no your service here pretty much ruined my day but thanks for the weak attempt
@united what you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... thanks for allowing me to miss my connection
@united such as deodorant shampoo toothpaste. seems like that would be limited to 70oz correct?
@united why was i forced to check my rollaboard on ua 715? plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvnnmltiw
@united please do not take my membership away :(

@united this flight has been amazing. this is the best flight i have ever been on i am not kidding. service is incredible!
@united not sure why you call it customer care. should be customer we do not care

@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. thank you!

@united since ua 1226 ord-ewr is delayed pushing it into meal time does that mean it will be catered with meals in first?

@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! you are the worst airline in the history of airlines! train your staff!
@united extremely disappointed in #flight6831. united left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. left psngrs 2 depart plane
@united besides landing the plane overall customer service experience has been poor. late flight and rude workers plus missing luggage
@united i was just calling the global services help desk so via phone.

@united lounge @ #heathrow used by @airnzusa http://t.co/6hjucp694l
@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. no tvs &amp; then the inflight wifi is currently unavailable #unitedairlines
@united i am not digging the new mileage earning plan. i would earn about 1/3 of the miles i do now. any changes to the award ticket prices?
@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at missing in action ill advised. you did it in roc and service went downhill. keep employees and fliers first
@united was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 minute on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? website was not working.
@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything. long lines!! #ua1523
@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? login through username and email have been down for at least three days.

@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
@united airlines first &amp; only time i ever fly your airline! what a disgrace. @jimtrotter_nfl i should've listened to your tweet! #horrible
@united diverged to burlington vermont. this sucks.
@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. there is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that has not left the gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
@united i sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #unitedairlines

@united your plane's been waiting at the gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. yuck.
@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. i trust the faa can handle this better.
@united 15.99 for wireless? was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? what will the faa &amp; nyt say ? http://t.co/bngpli8jt6
@united your airserv contractors are not worth a wet damn. 30min late flight still not done w bags on ua1566. they made checkin a calamity.
@united will never fly with you again! terrible service!! ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
@united web app won't let me upgrade seats call center wait time is 20 minutes plus just want to get more legroom but it is a pita
@united 132 characters does not cover my reasons i am afraid
@united while busy on his cell phone ???
@united really fill out a form about my flight experience? i sent an email to the 1k email address.
@united will the kudos to capt. herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should i be emailing someone?
@united on flight 1665 but it is not departing! website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? or do they just learn on their own? there was overhead space for my bag did not have to check
@united first officer of ua 1514 checking our 757 prior to departure from ewr yesterday while on his cell. safety ??? http://t.co/1tfh2v0a7z
@united i booked lh via ua. however at gate they rebooked me to a late flightr lh flight. now that flight didnt earn pqd for me. how do i get it
@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
@united i appreciate the immediate offer but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. also ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best
@united it isnt simple issue generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early am
@united terrible illogical re-route after cancelled flightled connection. then made me pay to check bag. then lost bag. #ual
@united i already follow you. one of you 800-number agents rebooked me. went from a 777 to an a320. ugh.
@united good job at cle .. tpa on schedule ... 4 to 5 inches of snow ! http://t.co/9tbsjquw41

@united ua 1706 there is no way a plane loses its software i believe you decided to do an upgrade...
@united already missed connection... ua 495
@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a cancelled flight...
@united ua 1706 delayed again - i get charged $600 if late flight by you - you say oh well

@united yes there were plenty of seats available. so why did vicky thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
@united funny both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with issues...
@united that would have been nice earlier today. too late flight now. i hope.
@united waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to global services....something going on?
@united no still trying to get home.
@united also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
@united that is not what your reservations desk just told me. they said there were plenty of seats
@united very exasperating i am having a difficult time with flight booking problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. really now?
.@united this flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. very touching!
@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
@united no i did not make connection. your stellar employee vicky thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
@united of course. that was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. its gone further downhill on my return.
@united no you do not
@united how much longer will it take? it a guitar not a royal commission!
@united i have a voucher that expires next week can i get an extension on it before it expires?
@united sure but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). that just seemed a little off.
@united you know what would be awesome? providing us with complimentary entertainment on your flights. especially those longer than 6 hours.
@united direct message sent. thanks.
@united to late flight now but in future flights train staff better to handle emergency situations and ground staff in customer service

@united awesome thank you very much for the help
@united you need to follow me so i can direct message you to give you the information
@united @airlines. agents arguing about check bag announcement. looked for room until seat 20 gave up and walked back to seat 7.unnecessary
@united yea i saw that i am moving to china and have 5-6 bags will pay whatever but wanted to make sure it was okay to bring that many
@united you should change your name to united incompetence. no flight until monday have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!
@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. as a business owner i would be mortified if my employees acted as yours
@united kept me watching the safety video for the first time in forever. nice job 👍.
@united has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. you just lost a customer
@united thanks to lea in the chicago office for her help in switching our cancelled flighted flights!!

@united it was not full i had plenty of time to go to the gate and check plus with my status i should have gotten on!?!
@united then why did your staff refuse to let me on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
@united thanks for nothing. next time i will bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. that makes sense right?
@united first you lost all my bags now you cancelled flight my flight home. 30 minute wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough

@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! i fly 100+ times a year &amp; she's one of the top flight attendants i have had!
@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. when will my 2+ day nightmare end?
@united you suck. @southwestair you're the best.
@united can you let us out of the gate now. ua1157
@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int’l leg now i’m sitting on the tarmac in houston 70 minute past departure w/ another hr plus to go
@united dtv doesnt work pilots late flight wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and i paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks
@united your loyalty team basically flipped me off via phone but thanks. maybe google loyalty and get back to me? ^lol
hey @united this is your job do not give me the safety spin. this is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedsucks
@united thank you
@united if you mean beyond opaque maintenance issues yes that would be basic in customer service which your ewr staff cannot manage.
@united dear ted. we do not care about you nor the mileage plus card you pay a lot for. bye bye. -- united
@united terminal 1 gate b3. flt 1299. then take her to terminal 5. gate m13. swiss air lx009
. @united sad that you do not think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
@united help! my girlfriend amy lloyd is going to miss our flt to zurich bc of your fault. she needs a golf cart to meet her at ordinance (1)
@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in pia! he walked away and quit! luckily a responsible pia agent saved the day!
@united that was the problem. we were being told the aircraft was on its way.
@united will do. thx. been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hours and now we have to refuel! i cannot even make this stuff up.
@united do you know how to use twitter bro? your terminal looks like it is in bosnia. here is another pic. http://t.co/m9nywr5kbs
@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. how is that possible.
@united i took care of it myself. had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. due to united errors.
@united now i will probably miss my next connection!
@united any chance you'll ever do cpus on your jfk-lax like @americanair?
@united you may think i am joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly late flight.
@united not the case. now delayed due to mechanical issues with no update on departure time. just cancelled flight the goddamn flight so i go delta
@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues? now over 1.5 hours late flight sitting on this plane. this is insane!!
@united i did not get a message from you. i will resend numbers.
@united yes filled out the form last year. do not have case number handy. guess i am not cut out for the historical society afterall
@united what idiot designed your seats? armrest tv remote &amp; resting elbows do not mix. seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
@united you can bump me up to group 3 so i won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at lga.
@united listen learn &amp; do this: remove your pqd requirement. it is insulting. ^ha
@united thank you for the reply. i will fill out the form and submit it as requested. good to know you're paying attention!
@united gate agent alavera is amazing
@united i need you...to be a better airline. ^lol
@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. when i received my bag i found your crew had stolen from me. you lost my business!
@united wins top marks for customer service via twitter. they turned a poor experience into a positive. many thanks for the effort! 👍
@united really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still do not have my bag!!!
@united why have not you released a travel advisory for iad for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
@united cross country flight sfo&gt;bos. no wifi not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30mtff
@united is really getting horrible. so much for tucking in my kids tonight. delta transfers miles/status right? http://t.co/h6hn33jjje
@united i just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back
@united i think problem resolution should be decided on your end. especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
@united roundtrip to london on @delta ? i think i will! for your information that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
@united already flight booking problems next week's trip on @americanair thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail
@united flight experiences are often frustrating but 2day on ua5184 from chi to wpg flight attendant april was #amazing! she's 1 of the best!
@united also group 5 is total bs.
@united do not ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
@united just like clockwork friday afternoon flights from las to den running late flight. why does this seem to happen so consistently #keepit100
@united i will! on @americanair @southwestair @delta or @jetblue all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
@united free booze for the bach party would make it better! ord--&gt;msy #delayed #again we will enjoy either way. thanks!
@united (2/2) i have their name (boarding pass was in there too). i think they might really need this. any ideas?
@united - sitting in seat 10d on a flight back from vegas to chicago. someone left a folder that looks important in the seat pocket. (1/2)
@united incompetent/rude service today. missed my connecting flight then the customer service desk was terrible to me. really upset w untd.
@united - terrible experience on ua415 on 17th. first exit row in economy has zero legroom. have same row booked for return but cannot change.
@united 5.5 hours late flightr i have been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous sfo
@united all good man it is not your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
@united this delay of flight ua4636 has been painful. i sure hope it does not cause me or my luggage) to miss my ua82 flight to new delhi!
@united yes but unbelievable. should have a free fare lock
“@united: @battierccipuppy your puppy is so cute. we look forward to having both of you on board. thanks for the high five. ^ey” 👏👏
@united it should be free like other airlines! again it’s not 1997 anymore.
@united existing reservation is fine. i was talking about no longer having an 0600 cmh-ord option. 0638 gets me in too late flight.
@united please tell me i am going to make my connecting flight from o'hare to #stl #southbendinwhere 🙏 http://t.co/qgwk10dewv
@united lindsay and ??. darn. terrible memory on my part. i know they are headed back to iad and then pit tonight.
@united i know. i’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. i’m a small guy 5’ 6” and i feel the new planes are tight
@united how about after 2.5 hours at ordinance another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
@united okay thanks for the clarification.
@united when are you coming back to @iflyoakland? you have a huge east bay customer base due to sfo and *i* miss you!
@united also does not help me. i am a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. apparently that means nothing.
@united delayed another hour
@united as a million mile flier i am embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched?
@united cannot beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too late flight. nws issued storm warning already...
@united @skywest do it again! i will now miss one or probably both our aspen events. #fail
@united do not need your apologies need my bag. took 56 minutes from landing to get it. unacceptable.
@united add wifi entertainment and the old seats and i’ll come back.
@united so we fly into sfo and honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays. i beg of you plz sort this out soon!
@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
@united super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the us. it isn’t 1997!
@united as for volunteers to give up seats people did! now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people! #letsgo
@united 4016 529557. you going to transfer my car to me too? because it is at the airport you could not get me too...
@united next time i will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space since you obviously cannot deliver it in a timely manner.
@united i am sorry it is cold in chicago but i do not see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel.
@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
@united you are making me miss big snow in montana. not cool.
@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
@united or frontier ... http://t.co/n8winfu6c5
@united thank you. any help is appreciated.
@united for your information went through this on similar flight last week.
@united i know where to check. my complaint is my ticket said dinner when i booked now it is changed to refreshments. where's my refund?
@united bag mia since wednesday. still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. any way my partner (on difference res) can use them? can we combine res?
@united or us air: http://t.co/eis9hcnpro
@united we cannot all be american airlines i suppose... http://t.co/0ewj7oklji
@united love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. let us make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
@united uhuh.group trying to get out of nashville and into iad today instead of tomorrowwhy be preemptive though... https://t.co/ybv0xaowkv
@united thanks for moving my dad on to my my mom's flight. you helped make his birthday start with #friendlyfriday awesomeness! 4 paws up!
@united you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights cancelled flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost! you never get it right.
@united blood services make your appt. today! 18009174929 http://t.co/6uxwpadugs
.@united it is worth saying that if you litter in singapore you get caned. but there are rules says @united
@united not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? iad is under winter storm warning tomorrow already what's up?
@united yes! i will be sending an email to customer service today.
@united i am fully aware it is just that your rules are harsh toward the client. especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $.
@united why i won't check my carry on. watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 minute http://t.co/lyoocx5msh
@united why? so i can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? disappointing as always.
@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
@united not 100% sure however my ticket included one checked bag therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated.
“@united: @d_goodspeed we will follow up with our maintenance team. thanks for the tweet. ^kp” thank you! united cares!
@united terribly disappointed. confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
@united this is for a check-in luggage. employee told me not to include wheels in the dimensions.
@united dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com
@united if i had a ticket refunded which i purchased for my brother to fly...could i then used the refunded credit for me to fly? respond
@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
@united its my one and only checked bag which is checked to edinburgh however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark
@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
@united thank you for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit flight attendant indicated it was not cleaned properly.
@united i have never been so grossed out in my life. what a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
@united need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow
@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour and then boarding us onto a flight that reeks of vomit because it was not cleaned properly
@united just landed. might want to check flight 304 plane from houston. that sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/qkquraggoo
@united i cannot even look at you right now. i will call you when i am not so mad.
@united direct message ed you the request number
@united i requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used hope they understand the problem from your approach
@united nope still sitting at the gate!
@united bagage which i take to in the cabin i dont need to check-incorrect?
@united exactly
@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
@united yes it is partly used the del-ewr is used the return flight was cancelled flightled due to technical glitch in operations
@united thank you.. appreciate the response
@united old school ride home to los angeles from houston #flyingretro http://t.co/6asuwx3kv0
.@united i appreciate you looking. can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? still have not taken off for a 10:30 am flight

@united thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines
@united another terrible experience with united. discrimination. delays. and no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
@united hi we are flying into iad tomorrow evening. do you expect delays or cancelled flightlations with the snow storm?
@united if a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers is it a good business decision? #cranky
@united sent a direct message just now. thanks i am incredibly happy the fast response i got via twitter than via customer care. thank you
@united please provide update on ua 791. this flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly southwest! get more agents at sfo 25!
@united perfect! that works! thank you!
@united that's still one day over my visa expiring on june 9 which is why i booked my flight on that day.
@united followback so i can direct message plz
@united mia-ewr #384 😄😄😄 excellent crew. ewr-iad #3589 😡😡😡 no crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
@united your customer service is crap.
@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
@united mechanical issue. looks like they got it fixed! thanks for your concern.
@united ua1023 sitting on tarmac at ordinance when there are visibly gates open. reassign our gate.
@united thanks
@united usually an issue with express our of sfo. positive note: mainline post script was enjoyable.
@united no. sato rebooked me. just upset that my travel office had to fix this and you couldn't.
@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/qdxft9qqt9
@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. dounotwantmybusiness?
@united @jedediahbila why is united voted every year as one of the worst airlines? do enjoy that title? you should give jedediah free passes
@united i think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #chitocle
@united on the plane but thanks! maybe do not let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
@united thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken tv. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
@united ua6357 needs de-icing! stat! we've waited our turn...
@united yes i have boarded this way many times &amp; have never had to show my pass on the tarmac multiple times. path was railed off. only 1 way
@united @bobwesson fair enough united. everybody is doing the best they can. although that slight delay is turning into a cancelled flightlation.
@united still waiting on our bag! never got delivered yesterday. cannot reach a real person for help. sending direct message with referee number.
@united worst flight experience i have ever had. will never ever fly your airline again.
@united why do i have to go through the details of the flight i want w/ the recording to then repeat all when a real person gets on the line?
@united looks like they came through. thanks again for the help.
@united anything yet jj?
@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
@united hey! direct message not working. ua 307!
@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. so it is like sir you are lying how can i help
@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
@united contd... i am being told that i am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got cancelled flightled how is the ticket used?
@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all i get is cold shoulder
@united i booked and paid for a flight to get me to denver at a specific time for a meeting. you failed... it was not caused by weather
@united since when did you get so good again! 4 transcontinental flights in 72h. what a pleasure/relief you were.
@united what i do not understand is not flight that i paid premium for getting cancelled flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
@united flight is awful only one lavatory functioning and people lining up bumping etcetera. because cannot use first class bathroom. ridiculous
@united are the current on board food menus available anywhere online?
@united airlines is changing its mileageplus program: winners and losers http://t.co/f1yvaio9ul http://t.co/vglx6ykwqg
@united actually we aren't. still parked here.

@united thanks!
@united thanks for prompt response. another hour to enjoy vacation! perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
@united why can i only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when i have multiple flights?

@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and i miss my next flight. this time you've lost my baggage. no clean clothes. $337 flight. thx!
@united i looked on the email chain and there is not one
@united why the hell do my miles expire? was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
@united thanks for more timely updates.
@united do you also want the naming rights to my first child so i can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
@united i am familiar with the procedure. it would not be the first time #unitedairlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
@united i get that. but doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading information does not seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
@united baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever flight#417 ogg to los angeles !!!
@united thanks. that means i have 30 minutes to make my international connection to hkg
@united @jedediahbila kp i am not traveling - we trying to cheer up ms. bila.
@united you just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when i tried to make a change over the phone not including $200 change fee. wtf?
@united thank you for your offer! all sorted out :-)
@united workin on it. waiting on him to reply.
@united flight 395. rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
@united i believe just customer service. at last post he was at narita in tokyo. they sent him to a motel to rest. said standby maybe 2days
@united i think this is the best first class i have ever gotten!! denver to los angeles and it is wonderful!!!
@united of course not. the inflight crew was great!
@united well played ^lo.
@united the pilot of ua475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. smoothest landing ever.
@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
@united the new seats on the canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
@united i am in another country - please cancelled flight my reservation. i have booked through swiss air
@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/sdylukr7pt via @robthecameraman
@united found the flight on @airfarewatchdog
@united that's the reply? laugh out loud hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 😒
@united did somebody say flight upgrade?
@united direct message sent.
@united how is it tripitpro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours late flightr i hear the same from you? just curious
@united trying to reach him for the number. at last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
@united this is very disappointing. this is about customer service.
@united boarded 6373 on time deplaned and now 100 minutes delay. no transparency during. cannot wait to give up my gold status for aa.
@united @44stocker my wife sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
@united once again i am victim to the scam that is your shit customer service this time the agent hung up on me what the fuck do you teach your staff
@united flight 1219. my frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. her attitude was ridiculous.
@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. free directtv for everyone! ever hear of preventative maintenance?
@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and i can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here. what are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/ph8qjzapkx
@united so going forward i should not be flight booking problems star alliance flights through the united app?
@united i have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
@united i am not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. or maybe i am extra bloated.
@united direct message sent. this lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
@united delayed going home again. getting really tired of delays.
@united a big thanks to ^mn and ^kn or patiently clarifying the united domestic world to me.
@united uh - i booked it through the ua website. why the price change?
@united i am rebooked. getting home 4 hours late flightr then planned. what are the chances i will ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
@united united club team is a+ &amp; got me a seat late flightr. still not sure why a last minute ual cancelled flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?
@united will flight 5559 to yyc be providing free food when we are allowed back on board after the broken lightbulb
@united i was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight. do not understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
@united thank you so much that helps a ton. whoever is on this twitter account today deserves a handshake and a hot chocolate flight. #problemsolvers
@united i left headphones in 2a on ua4689 from yhz-ewr. it is a long shot to see them again. but worth a tweet anyway!
@united 129 thousand fans of @jedediahbila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
@united cannot wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/odlall5edh
@united flight 5187 to be specific. the last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
@united love being told you would issue a refund when you could not get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
@united without baggage for 5 days and cannot get an update from houston airport since monday. worst service ever!
@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. overkill
@united bummer. might have to go with @americanair card instead. thank you for response though.
“@united: @lruns4cupcakes please direct message details we'd like to help if you need assistance. ^kp” @clarkhoward #another #airlines #issues
@united or i am sure her business will go else where for airline travel. her name is kathryn sotelo
@united please arrange someone at the arriving gate of flight 5957 to chicago for either a refund or first class upgrade
@united made to check in my carry on from flight 1449 pbi to newark. plane luggage stow not full. you are costing me time money &amp; aggravation!

@united just emailed jim compton and jeff smisek so hopefully you pay attention now
@united i hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
@united deserves to go bankrupt. just delayed an outbound flight with no information on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
@united flt 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but cannot board because flight crew did not stay in boarding area #fail
@united not anymore. finally was ticketed 5 minute before takeoff. not sure why the confusion with a full-fare gsa ticket.
@united do miles earned with explorer card count toward lifetime miles?
@united yes but they still do not know where it is. i have been told it might be on a flight but now no one can confirm it.
@united what do i do if something is missing from my checked baggage?
@united wind chill in ithica -17 degrees and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. i will burn it for warmth. #united
@united aw thanks for the kind words. totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport soooo much better.
@united frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. when is united?

@united #4781 cancelled flightled. #5102newflight i will be upset if this one cancelled flights too. i could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
@united enjoyed #heathrow lounge so much i almost missed my @airnzusa flight!
@united hi flight 1051. if i try and book a new one way flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate.
@united stuck in. ordinance because united cannot find their airplane. lol. #upset terminal right now.
@united who can i contact about requesting a charity donation? #thankyou
@united what the heck be honest with your customers. this better be the last change or we are driving home. has our plane left or not!
@united second time in a row i have been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket why? #united i should not have to check my cc everytime
@united i need a customer service manager to contact me please
@united is flight 5001 really going to leave newark today? if not tell us now and i will rent a car. i do not want to end up stranded.
.@united thanks for the reply. i saw that but it is not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. shrug.
@united so funny that my boarding pass said priority a because clearly i am not a priority to this airline
@united i am sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through twice this month. tweets do not cut it
@united or you'll cancelled flight my flight like you just did
@united screwing me over twice in one month. learned my lesson. we are through.
@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
@united will do cheers
@united please send me the link/email to formally compliment irene in slc on some of the best customer service ever. #paxex
@united thnx ^lo :-)
@united yes. houston int'l bush.
@united hi. my 2/23 flight from cun-ewr shows a departure of 2:55pm on my united app. can you confirm? does not look correct. thanks.
@united flight from vegas to houston cancelled flighted this morning due to operation what does this mean!???? thank god i woke up early today!
@united will do! thanks!
@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
@united item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #ewr to #yow flight. missing a black box? http://t.co/sjqemdtqma
@united my guess:flight is going to be cancelled flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
@united instead of making seats smaller/thinner so you can jam more people on a flightu should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers
@united i need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
@united gates were definitely not full. we were parked and wheels were chocked. customer service called it an unmet arrival!!
@united @abigailedge another glitch??
@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by janet and baggage employee karen. you have 2 wonderful employees united.
@united i really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
@united to start 3xdaily @embraersa #erj145 flights from #chicago @fly2ohare to #evansville on 4jun #avgeek
@united flight 4465 almost half an hour at the tarmac waiting for papers... cannot miss my connection at iah !
@united worst airline ever. thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
@united no chance in hell. i would rather walk. worst airline ever.
@united is the worst major us airline. more proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather. wtf?
@united
@united always makes our cross country flights rad. @hemispheresmag here is baby flier charlotte! #8thtime5monthsold http://t.co/kcqnwixucm
@united too late flight damage has been done. easily the worst airline experience of my life. missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #ua49
@united do not know if you are aware that all of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. i feel the love.
@united #firstclass to #london on my way to #londonfashionweek #lfw15 👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧
@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on psalms jfk flights. will be looking at alternatives.
@united just kidding with you i will send you my stuff now. thanks
@united @faanews unacceptable practice to leave cancelled flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #ua1724 http://t.co/ndtlj15zpu
@united can you get the crew member that we are waiting on? we were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
@united flight 6212...massive fail! they delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! unreal!
@united i had the worst customer experience at houston intl airport... your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
@united tremendous. what would you recommend?
@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
@united i am counting on you please do not let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce
@united why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger and their luggage to their final destination?
@united -huge kudos to the fo of sunday's flt #1623 sjo-iad. handed my daughter her first pair of wings! keeping traditions alive.
@united awesome new plane flight 1701
@united #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation
@united oh united how much i despise thee!
@united lets see of we can do this today! hoping for an on-time department #dullestostatecollege #runningonthreehoursofsleep #delayedovernight
@united flt 912. captain herman is amazing! came out before flight to play ask the captain anything. wonderful ambassador to the airline!!
@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
@united what is going on with baggage claim in newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! except today in mco where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
@united 2.5 hour delay misplaced bag poor communication and the worse: unsympathetic confrontational gate agent. not cool!!!
@united why do not you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! i am still wating for my tickets!! i am getting really angry and disappointed!
@united then send your jeff smisek on a trip with jetblue or sw and make sure he takes notes. i would never choose to fly united again.
@united so disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. such a bummer.
@united pre-dawn flight to #miami from #ewr. annual #sobewff trip. now.
thanks @united great news that you won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. i knew you would come to your senses @gg8929 @unitedappeals
@united thank you for a wonderful global first class flight on your 777 to fra. great service. (cont) http://t.co/46n9kdcsxu

thank you united! “@united: @dan_roam that's a beautiful place to stay a day longer. have you been re-booked? if not let me know. ^mn”
@united to top it all off your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight even when the lights were dimmed. resulting in no sleep
@united it seems like no one from united can help me. lots of fingers pointed zero people stepping up. at least the gate has oreos
@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
@united i will be impressed if i actually get a response! 😜
@united hi i left my asus tablet on flight to heathrow from newark on 16th february and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
@united 1hr delay at the start huge queues at security no representative to meet us rude staff at baggage reclaim #inefficient
@united has the worst flight attendants. they are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. everything has to be an argument.
@united its in black and white. eu law and all that €600 for a cancelled flightled flight. i want my money
@united accordingly? you dont respond at all
@united the extra care airline. #unitedairlines they do not care. trust me. there #customerservice is non existent. they do not have 1
@united another unfortunate case of bad luck usually maintenance issue. they are now swapping planes to ontario will get in late flight. :(
@united it is a shame the great customer service was not continued in sfo. slightly absurd
@united #onlyinamerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. bad pr guys.
@united still awaiting a reply from your customer services? 18 days no response? lousy #unitedairlines
@united alright thank you. much appreciated.
@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
@united thanks i am booked. just spent an extra 7 hours in the ten w/ no explanation. now flying middle seat to character instead of memphis.
@united agent rick clifton in sea-hou told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful
@united any chance you are allowing reflight booking problems yet for travel out of denver this weekend due to impending storm?
we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to first class. prebooked? really? @united: @jenniferwalshpr your dissatisfaction is und
@united thanks yup i am all set. it happens. slc ground staff were prompt helpful and courteous.

@united all good did not die or anything. as they say you get what you pay for!
@united thank you so much. how will you be able to contact me?
@united maybe on my return trip 👍
@united your staff at laguardia and lagos nigeria were unprofessional uncaring and not helpful. ou
@united i got it at the gate thanks for checking!
@united you kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service. leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
@united i especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
@united hello. i got off a flight a few months ago and constantly think about your peanuts. is there anyway you could send me some?
@united flt 359 los angeles to ewr. your pilot bragged about getting to ewr early only to wait 20 minute for a jetway driver. thanks united!
@united i am so happy i found my phone because this is easily the worst system i have ever heard of
really? 9+hours???? @united: @jenniferwalshpr we do not like delays and do all we can to avoid them. we'll have you on your way as soon as possible
@united @robbogart after i waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. why cannot ual be honest with its customers?
@united round trip*
@united well. as of yet our checked bag has already vanished and we have not left the airport yet.
@united thanks. not tonight it would seem. http://t.co/wndceo5qlk
@united a rapid trip plane ticket from idaho to california that does not have problems would be wonderful
@united agent did help me. my point: there's a problem &amp; i do not want it to mess up somebody else's plans. can you flow this to technology team pls?
.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. i am also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.never again
@united please do! she went above and beyond what she had to do she made us her number one priority!
@united you guys are awesome! thanks!
@united thnx
@united i think we both have the same status (nothing). i think there was a bug in your search system.
@united anna palm springs gate 19 deserves a medal! handled 30 people missing flights like a pro!
@united i would appreciate an answer on why we were not alerted flight had been cancelled flighted until plane landed. #showsomerespect

@united nice 2 see you have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay just want 2 b home but i will settle for that beer. once safely in the air of course
@united surprised to go from 1k last year to nothing this year. what happened to the soft landing policy of no more than 1 level?
@united (2/2) pay in person at portland airport. i will be flying from perth. this has been done by us air.
@united she was at the service desk at gate 21 and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got cancelled flightled
@united (1/2) thanks but does not answer my question. i want to make a reservation over the phone in perth hold for 24hrs and have family
@united it was not a delay so much as a straight cancelled flightlation. weather was not an issue either.
@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. flight ua4904 from ewr to rdu is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
@united cancelled flightled my flight for some unknown reason and have not really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. learn from @delta
@united yes my flight was rebooked. i am just losing trust in you if i want to get anywhere on time.
@united thanks keep up the good work
@united 4 reflight booking problemss in last 2 days and each time united wait time was &lt;5 seconds! kudos to you for excellent customer service!
@united any solutions?
@united what do you have in mind?
@united i am over you. evry first flight i take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry second is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup

@united it is cool. your customer told me they did not care either. it is expected
@united is freaking worthless. i hate this airline. http://t.co/dn1if2cgwe

@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ordinance @5:59pm - dpted 8:30pm -checked week's average for ua3645 -shameful! 7 day average 7:54pm
@united i understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why first class? there were 5 empty coach seats near me? i am a premier 1k?
@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane only for you to alert us flight is cancelled flighted when it lands. #whatstatus
@united can someone at the airport in portland or buy a ticket to be picked up and used 2days late flightr by other from perth australia? thanks
@united they did on a delta flight out of los angeles which is why i should be compensated for my rental car there.
@united what happens on 9:11 a.m. of 9/11 2spooky 4me m8 such spook much scare
@united i missed it. set up in a hotel. flights delayed in sfo for 6+ hours. missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 😞

@united that would be great - 1k us651621

@united @dmb41shows i need this plane to get to buffalo so i can leave tonight. any progress?
@united i was rebooked however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 minute at the airport. how will you make this right?
@united enough already with the poor service old planes ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match.
@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. and this plane is cold.😡
@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zouowgv3q6
@united how do you have a scheduled flight with no crew? is there a competent person working at this airline?
@united can you help 689 in chicago get to a gate. freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
@united thanks kp. what's going on w/4840 tonight. bad update online and phone. cannot you give customers good info. not waste their time?!
@united just got my lost kindle in the mail! thanks again.
@united is z and d code airfare refundable?
@united no did not notice i was 38a until start of boarding. assumed i was 8e. by time boarding started gas had cleared standbys full flt
@united 4840 you knew this flight was delayed! mht to alb to ewr to get crew. your arrival is late flightr than the departure! update your site!

@united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. that's the last flight out tonight. help http://t.co/hbsj2sf17h
@united ordinance gate c25 and flt 619- remember when customers were valuable? is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
@united worst service ever. denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. how hard is it to schedule a gate? @delta next time.
@united i am in denver my bag is in san jose. see something wrong here.
@united you know it is bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #justgetmehome
@united playing hide and seek with the gate. we cannot find it it should only be a few more minutes.
@united so our flight into ordinance was delayed because of air force one but the last flight to sbn is at 8:20 5 mins from now we just landed.
@united your flights are really cheap what's the catch
@united lgjw7b. i voluntarily rerouted; first leg of journey was in economy and was supposed to be 8b. res agent said she would reserve it for me
@united 5.5hrs late flightr and you still cannot figure it out. random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vftuyjh45x
@united stop picking on us #cle http://t.co/vtqe8m1l3i
@united booked flight in september to get best price for april to usa checked now and they are €67 cheaper what a con unhappy customer #ripoff
@united too big to properly manage flight times. there is such a thing as being on time. or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
@united i would rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. trying to get home to this. http://t.co/u69fafqhsf
@united leaving soon. thanks!
@united another #delayed day. #delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at ewr for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
@united cancelled flighted my mileage plus award reservation g6455c same day. have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.
@united my partner and i booked individual reservations for same flight. i have pr. silver -- can he share my premier privileges somehow?
@united 3 gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to roanoke and flight to sous falls in o'hare... painful
@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it is still in albany and they won't have a plane. someone is compensating me
@united doumented via link. however now that it has been over four months with no response what do you suggest? or shall i not expect one?
@united what?! y'all have zero concept of customer service. oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
.@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. seems crucial to the flight process no?
@united sent dm's
@united just changed again. this is crazy! #youragentshavenoclue http://t.co/a37n3ohokl
@united never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. makes 10 straight delays
@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? this is a mess! what are you going to do to compensate?
@united - blamed weather laugh out loud 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! delayed both ways 4x!! ru kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to lon;flight cancelled flighted with no reason less than 2 days before returning.
@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this. really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
@united should contact me and the others on my flight who cannot get their website to work. none of our information is valid! http://t.co/3zpjr7kwbk
@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
@united line up @iah #iah @airlinegeeks #avgeek http://t.co/djhxvjt201
@united silence is very telling
@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. at least you did not break my http://t.co/gcwvfuopl2
@united bought a round trip to chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! is there any way for me to get that discount??
@united am i illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcks2bh5
@united worst airline ever! staff is nasty wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? and now the belt is broken. selling ual stock in am
@united stars and bars @iah #a320 @airlineguys @airlinegeeks #avgeek http://t.co/mwsoguc33p

“@united: @robcnyc see information on our boarding process: http://t.co/gbiw9ugfnm ^kp”. i get group 1&amp;2. just no reason on 3/5.
@united in bogota with no wallet is no fun. :-(
@united lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from houston to bogota. filled out your online form. no response yet.
@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
@united i am now following you and see that i am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. different gate maybe?
@united how can you never got a flight from austin to houston in time for a connection ever? ever!
@united got it right with the safety demonstration! corporate but funny reserved but not corny as a… http://t.co/lwotkiekgu
@united now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother
@united look at the twitter history - as usual service non existent
@united thanks for the reply. i have been in contact with customer care to get clarification on this issue.
@united i will give it a couple more weeks. thank you.
@united make sure you make cancelled flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
@united how is this considered on time if it is arriving at destination half hour late flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/ymftw1uyhr
@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. in any other industry you cancelled flight a service a refund is issued. cont…
@united and there is no direct phone number for status match desk? i really regret flight booking problems with @united now.
@united yet again you disappoint. sitting at iad for ua3728 for 3.5hrs and you cannot seem to know why the plane has not left albany. #fail
@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
@united thanks for the help. wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. lady working the counter is doing great she just needs help. #customerservicefail
@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
@united flight was too heavy so had to fly back to palm springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
@united your boarding process sucks. you should learn from @southwestair
@united ouch delays due to mechanical issues again qro will have to wait! you all seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail
@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point a-&gt;b than united airlines!
@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in houston airport? line 3 rows deep 1 person working
@united i will stick with my united flight. thanks though. effort is much appreciated.
@united your survey is too long. i fly a lot of segments and i will fill it out after every trip but not if it takes more than a minute.
@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at ewr? been waiting for bags for 1 hr. united = overcharged&amp;underserved
@united fair enough. i do not usually rant but it is good to know someone's listening. :)
@united are you telling me that you are now cancelled flighting my flight ??
@united would be hard to be worse than last time but i am sure you'll give it a shot
@united thank you for the delta transfer. will my bags go too?
“@united: @sonyasloanmd happy to have had you on board. please share details here: http://t.co/2trgemtebz ^kp” done!
@united service staff to is less than friendly!
@united happens every time in and out of newark.
@united can you transfer my bags too?
@united i am a comedian and i promise i will make fun of you on stage tonight.

@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at ewr?!? line is 15 people deep. grow up!
@united more concerned that you close a club i paid alot for at 10. last flight 11:15p. the construction going on is very inconvenient.
@united perfect! thank you!
@united care less about the person - although he walked away while i was complaining. a man at 10p at los angeles club. more.....
@united smiling? not!!
@united worst airline in the world-8 delays gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 i already paid!!
@united will i make it with the delay?
@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline

@united i am on standby for my connecting flight. first on the list. nudgenudge i am told there are four slots open. save it for me. please.
@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel i am officially done. on time is not in their vocab. i am taking my premier status to a

@united just got interrogated at the united club chicago. #unitedairlines #rude #poorform
@united i just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line
@united can i access frankfurt arrival lounge when i am flying global first class?
@united keeps delaying my flight horrible customer service
@united has the best pilots ever thank you guys for the great trip #thatisall
@united - i really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go. how about you look @aircanada?

@united what delivery service do you use? i would like to call them myself.

@united or did you mean 24-26?
@united has it been 4-6hrs yet?
@united anyone awake? paying for wifi on iphone when need to be using it on laptop. logout option for wifi in flight? time is wasting!

@united no it weighed 45.5 and it was the only checked bag
@united still waiting for a response on whether or not you allow use of a rear facing car seat on an erj145.
@united nonrefundable hence i wrote $200! does not make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks
@united your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all information in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight i bought went up!
@united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment. i am not sure i understand your tweet.
@united i am a minor and freaking out bc i might not make my connecting flight to hawaii so yes i am frustrated
@united so sorry. i ended up on us air flight. thank you though for getting back to me:)
@united i have been denied. not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime
@united @estellevw does she need to complain on twitter for the refund or is it auto-applied?
@united even so change could not be made online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!
@united case id 8544484
@united no i have a pricey chase mileage plus cc.
@united your airbus a320 seats are awful. they do not recline.
@united to direct message you i have to follow you and i am not doing that. plus they're no more options. that's why i had to fly with you. #epicfail
@united great way to start my vacation with an on time departure! looking forward to my global first class suite!
@united - why am i sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry
@united thank you for responding so promptly! i look forward to the 240 kms drive to the office to file a claim.

@united flt 1583 ewr to sfo excellent service. friendly flight attendants. made the 6am flight a very good start to the day.
@united yes ! :d (y) from @therealaviation on instagram :)
@united @perfectomobile you really should not use the word 'crashing.' just sayin'.
@united airlines delayed our flight on the way to chicago and leaving chicago. next time @delta it is.
@united they inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they’re interested. responded to your direct message and no response back...
@united i must stop my relationship with you. you've become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over
@united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @gopro camera. i also appreciate not being interrupted every time i speak thanks
@united you need to follow me i order for me to dm....
@united can i get a refund? i would like to book on a better airline.
@united whom can i call to discuss - as i was told that united has no phone contact with passengers - this is absurd...
@united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. it is still in newark. please help or let me know next steps!!
@united airlines is changing #mileageplus program march 1 http://t.co/4oje523ptw
@united there is only one club at los angeles - in terminal 7 across from gate 71
@united @perfectomobile definately not an award for employer of the year #united13
@united i guess that's not the busiest route so based on traffic/fuel costs regional jet is the decision but still not great 4 travelers.
@united flight delayed 40 minutes in ordinance because plane didn’t have all the food. that should be fixed in the future. it’s a dumb delay.
@united need to change flight from this tuesday to sooner to attend to ailing parent in fl need help!! #custserv

@united for my grandma ella's 80th she would love a birthday greeting from your flight crew! she was a stewardess for eastern airlines.
@united is hiring - flight dispatcher - chicago il (network operations centerl) https://t.co/lio6ocpteq
@united that doesn’t make any sense. i’ve been 1k for over 5 years and you’re making it harder to keep me loyal.
@united have all 747-400s been updated with power outlets and seat-back tvs yet? flying ordinance to tokyo-narita on the 28th
@united i need you to get my cousin to pdx she's on 2 days of travel now and we've had to hire other sitters til she arrives thanks for that
@united keep the flights cheap and early/on time and you are good. flew @americanair and cancelled flightled my flight 4 times last month. united&gt;
@united the premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @americanair. only problem is now i have to pay for a checked bag :/
@united i did and as i thought nothing happened
@united i am not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
@united the flt to ordinance is correct. per my dm- it is the flight from ordinance to cvg i was charged for incorrectly
@united you need to change the way customer service is handled! i have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days what gives?
@united i need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. please advise on how to make that happen.
@united i know i can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. i do not understand why there was not a better estimate 3 hours ago
@united any news?
@united where we trick you into making us look popular on twitter by being the worst airline #wellplayed #jokesonus
@united why do i have to request refund? why charge twice in first place?
@united i will be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
@united i’ve filled out the form twice. no email. i have a lost item code. can you verify it was received?
@united message sent. thank you!
@united that's what i have been told. but refund does not really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... does it?
@united please explain why i need to pay bag fees twice equally $1200 because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?
@united - watched the entire #uncvsduke game on the tarmac before cancelled flighting my flight because crew timed out right before my 4hr flight....
@united reflight booking problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. also did not wanna take a chance booked myself on @etihad instead
@united - who can eat at an airport for $7? #areyounew? #incompetent #no800number #feeltheheat
@united - vacation days: relevant ritz in pr for the night: $700 losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the newark ramada; #priceless
@united - that time when i spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
@united i am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! this is hell!!
@united for your information the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights i had errors with. almost 24 hours after sellout. flying @americanair
@united sure... you've been saying that for as long as i have been tweeting about your obsolete fleet. promises are free.
@united followed and messaged. thanks so much for the help.
@united i did not. that's why i am very concerned.
@united please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). make sense?
@united i will never be flying with #unitedairlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? all under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
@united thanks jt
@united trying to locate passenger that landed 2 hours ago in @heathrowairport ua938. can you assist? is flight still in customs? please help
@united thank you! off to la to do something very special.
@united the flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15. never to fly united again as they do not check their planes properly.
@united is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform versus passengers? one is in 1b on flt 1020 now to iah
.@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now.
@united ua1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all i get is $50 voucher? will tweet when i book next trip not on ua.
@united spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees. random stranger comes up and pays the fee. #randomactsofcorporategreed
@united for a fee...

@united ewr people told me to call 1800# have 2x/day since monday. still at layover loc. have that referee # tho. any help appreciated.
@united ruth was very helpful in re-routing us to punta cana when dulles connection failed. other reps- not so helpful.
@united thank you!! 😊
@united we booked at the same time and he called was told confirmed we were linked. even after he had to make changes to his rez.
@united you board a 630a flight and then cancelled flight it because it does not have a pilot? now i miss my meeting atlanta because someone slept in?
@united i do not have a milage number. i cannot sent my mail to you via direct message you're not following me. i follow you now so you can sent me a direct message
@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
@united thx. come hell or high water...
@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting
@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. too bad the pilots did not do the same. #stillwaiting.
@united refund?
@united aisle please
@united thanks for the quick reply! i just fill in the form #idnumber8569822 #hopetogetanswersoon
@united - handed a slip of paper&amp;said to call 1800#. have called 2x/day trying to get it sent still @ layover airport.have that referee # tho.

@united that's fine. i will take them.
@united i live abroad and am flight booking problems flights for when i come visit the states :(
@united i have.
@united to recap you bounced me off my flight lied to me then hung up on me. what am i supposed to think/do now?
@united thank you! my second flight i already got bumped up to 1st! love it!
@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. while waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. i explained the situation...again...
@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back late flightr...
@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
@united all goods i will call tomorrow thanks.
@united next day
@united i filled out the form but i haven’t received any sort of email confirmation that it’s been received. is that normal?
@united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. i just want to get to @startingbloc in the am!
@united oh flight was fine. my lost luggage? not so much. looks like i will be at least a half day late flight to my conference in santa monica...
@united 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife
@united @unitedflyerhd @united_airline n26902 dreamliner leaves london heathrow. @b787fans http://t.co/ai0yzwt8za
@united ^gj flight 1101 did not have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #anotherdisappointment
@united ^gj i will. you have to agree that 7+ hours late flight for arrival is unacceptable. i only hope and pray my bag is here.
@united ok. can i direct message you the info?
@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
@united this happens all the time. united pilots are always in the exit row. america treats there customers better than their employees.
@united yes when i got to the gate i specifically asked if there where any other seats. very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
@united koa-lax should have fresh food service right?
@united oh my god thank u😻😻😻
@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or travelocity (2of2)
@united error message said could not process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
@united 4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate in empty msp airport than it was in flight 50 minute and still counting...
@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate ..shows total miss management . value customer time and respect thier sentiment
@united very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at bos who was rude in stopping a carry-on bag...
@united your service sucks to mexico from houston. you finally realized that snacks in1st do not work you cheap as);:
@united will do. thank you!
@united okay thank you both.
@united they had snacks available just no fresh food...not sure what happened but i am sure we will grab a bite before our sfo connection
@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn’t carry on 3 bags i will defend you for free.
@united done as requested.
@united please post video of belligerent jerk ranting at sfo (1230) that's he is going to sue you for making him check his third bag. he is a hoot!
@united ^gj i do believe that this is hands down the worst service i have ever experienced. makes @comcast look amazing. #unitedairlines
@united please give special thanks to aaron in tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! he is amazing. mission accomplished!
@united i cannot tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a lufthansa flight for the first leg.
@united turkish airlines rebooked us a united flight on our second leg from fra -&gt; iad. is there any way to check if upgrades are available?
@united hey i left my favorite blanket on the plane bring it back home to me:-(
@united ^gj funny i did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #runaround
@united followed &amp; dm'd.
@united i want a hotel room and a whiskey.
@united flight...gotta make this connector
@united - okay noted. all details will be dm'ed to you shortly.
@united @staralliance the b gates are very far though
@united ua5029 from ric ua507 from ordinance &amp; ua423 from den -all delayed for non-weather issues. way to go youre batting 1.000! but no hotels
@united i would have made it if you had not already booked me on another flight and cancelled flighted my original reservation.
@united @staralliance how can i book reward travel in august?? everything is blacked out.
@united did i win :)
@united trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help?
@united i have submitted my complaint. i need to be compensated. how long will this take?
@united any information on delays at sfo tomorrow due to low clouds?
@united because of the horrific flight experience you guys have made me never want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!
@united flight to rsw tonight -me &amp; twin 3 year olds. a pilot who was in row by me stayed to help me get the boys &amp; bags off. lifesaver!!
@united my flying united is over...sorry. the captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
@united thanks
@united yes thx! at 10:35 (landed at 9:20).
@united get a clue. i am a 1k/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
@united i was only trying to get my emails. what are you talking about? what most business people expect from airline wifi
@united we finally just arrive to bogota good but long flight!!
@united it is not there we tried. it is already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. i will be in touch but not through your customer feedback
@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went through
@united yes we are in ewr and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
@united want to make my day? :) friend is premier &amp; i should be soon. any chance you can upgrade our two 10 hr leg of flights to ecom plus?
@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
@united nothing else from you ^gj? where is your customer service?
@united that's of course in los angeles
@united okay thanks! where are you counters located? and how late flight are they open?
@united oh no i am rebooked 7+ hours after my original arrival time. we can talk compensation.
@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
@united lost my parents luggage to cancun said it would be delivered to hotel by 7pm it is now almost 11pm
@united then watched my connecting flight in den pull away from the gate only to pull into the same gate. #slapintheface
@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738 row 11 has no window at all. go ahead check. we'll wait.
@united i am pretty sure i have got shin splits from sprinting through iah only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to fll so yes hotels were necessary
@united can you please stop cancelled flightling your flights? i am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. you've cancelled flightled 3 flights on me.
@united &amp; i have been hung up on twice by your staff. so upset right now
@united dca-ewr flight #4372
@united 2 hour flight from fll to ewr 1242 now waiting 1 hour plus for bags no sign yet. what gives????
@united was such a better airline when you were continental. $75 service fee + $75 flight booking problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: fu!!!
@united any chance you could look into my problem from earlier?
@united this is despicable i spoke to many difference people &amp; everyone is telling me something different i have a claim no. i need my bag now
@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and i get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
@united funny thing happened we arrived on our flight from denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for sydney at! lol!
@united i forgot that intl flights out of los angeles do not go from intl terminal! easiest re-check in ever! woo!
@united can you please tell me where united flies to from sydney australia - preference asia pac or us as i have a voucher to redeem.
@united you cannot claim weather with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! do the right thing. but we both know you won't
@united you're missin the point! there was no weather. you're lying! seats was broken. but you claim weather to get out of hotels. classy
@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
@united i have flights that do not appear to have been applied to my mileageplus account. can you help?
@united @vusa_australia i am just an aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. take me to fort worth estelle says i will find him there!
@united okay thank you for your help :)
@united this is not what captain said! your 820pm flight to san francisco is delayed due to weather. ua1416 now departs ....#failagain
@united thanks
@united i bet @southwestair does not turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
@united is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love shopping in usa's fashion capital #newyork #unitedvusa http://t.co/rbn7stuij1
@united should find a way to distinguish boarding of premier members and credit card holders. group 2 is too big!

@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it does not look good. may have to stay here till friday &amp; that's not guaranteed
@united ^jt is the ordinance to phl flight at 9:15 pm (cdt) delayed? direct message i am kinda hoping not to be stranded at ordinance either.

@united plz do not advertise wifi if it is not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
@united hi guys. i submitted a request for ticket/hotel reimbursement for a delayed/over night stay coming back from the dominican. help?
@united apologize to the president. once those employees blamed him i heard it repeated 20 times.
@united yes i want to complain. your coworker was neither. is there a customer service point airside?
@united a change fee of $200. same exact flight from atl-hou is $165. why a charge of $574? the mathematics does not add up.
@united hello. i am overseas &amp; my bag is lost. i cannot call customer service but can you help me?

@united thnx
@united it is kinda funny. no worries.
@united my feedback and concerns via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
@united just dropped bags at newark. your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person i have met. even my two children were shocked!
@united great. looking forward to your response to my direct message then
@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair cancelled flightled all their flights to nashville
@united thanks for the re-upgrade to first class. it may be a 45 minute flight but it is appreciated.
@united makes total sense except flight was not full :) i have got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when i boarded.
@united now we are trying to get to san juan from chicago o'hare. having lots of problems. may get a standby flight.
@united alright thank you. is there a page that says the routes you have for each aircraft? specifically the 787.
@united well sorta....we are trying to get to aquadilla pr but only 1 flight goes there a day. all are booked. ua cancelled flighted our flight to nj
@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8fmzzoltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
@united i just sent a long note with some suggestions. thanks for getting back to me.
@united there are at least 3 of us on ua1564 at ordinance waiting to deplane to catch ua4232 to clt. any chance of waiting to last second for us?
@united @parryaftab done thnx
@united i am still frustrated i gave up my seat &amp; the promised travel certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/kvfwajvvid
@united gotta love giving up first class upgrade b/c flight delayed to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure i make my connection.
@united pty to pit via iah
@united not sure what happened @ msp yesterday but very unhappy my bag was not only delayed but sat at msp for 8 hours b4 delivery @ 2:30 am
@united is it possible to redeem miles for one part of a round trip itinerary without having to book two separate reservations?
@united i am flying @americanair on the way back. i rarely fly them but let us see if they are any better....
@united sent
@united it is almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. ewr was top ranked for domestic delays. not good
@united honestly i stopped trying to report things via website. now i just laugh. flights work. miles accrue. i am sure it is just cosmetic.
@united thanks. weather is understandable but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights it is crazy
@united #1007 houston-bogota boarding again safety first it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster good energy to fly home/family
@united no tag number. luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
@united have reported it. still in istanbul at the moment apparently. on the other plane haha. hats off to the pilot!
@united understandable. i did try flight booking problems several times for 2 passengers &amp; got the messages i mentioned before. as for the agents price???
@united hey awesome! thanks for the reply will be filling the form out! @americanair
@united flying tomorrow from mexico to us. mileage tkts dont show 1k status. help
@united correct date is 2/11/15!
@united 3 phone reps. none could see i was rebooked so missed that flight.told to go standby for a nonexistent late flightr flight. did i hurt you?
@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th february-i have the police case number if required
@united cannot direct message you're not following. lly144. rebooked on #ua1516 but still need seats.
@united the supervisor on situation- stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate. #ua507
@united tks for reply. psp employees blamed late flight departure on potus when main reasons were dvr flt late flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
@united took this one just for you. not a window. also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rv0blxs
@united they are all -pilots fa and ground personnel doing a great job. weather is to blame... who do i talk to about that :)
@united i find this text funny considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/loluwfci11
@united #1007 houston-bogota with an engine problem mechanics trying to fix the problem safety first better to change the plane
@united thanks! makes sense. just annoying that it cannot be determined better.
@united patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience
@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how i feel about your overpriced sub par airline
@united idea: if you do not want us to be frustrated do not cancelled flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. get a plumber
@united i will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
@united i will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane does not arrive until 6:07
@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 february 2014 at albuquerque airport
@united be patient while i let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
@united i think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then cancelled flightled mine
@united's in-flight promo on their tv's includes brian williams. tough to edit that quickly. not a complaint just an observation.
@united thanks i will fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
@united i was patient when they refused to switch my flight bc of my checked bag then cancelled flightled the one i was on
@united sent direct message last week re: suit regarding your error. no response was given. please answer direct message or tell me who to send suit to....
@united will have to try standby in denver tonight or will have to cancelled flight father son trip till next year. thanks for trying.
@united i wrote to you but got nothing.and i am out of us .it is very simple thing.will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
@united how many 787s do you currently operate and what other aircraft do you operate?
“@united: @qlyss8 we do not want our customers to be frustrated. thank you for your patience. ^jt” a lovely sentiment but not a $180 one.
@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for ua304??? in 1hr. please!
@united nope. really. no window at all for 10a. 10f has one. 8 and 11 has one. none for 10a. so sad...
@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles peas and zukes. non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. can you do better?
@united well thanks for not charging me for switching my two cancelled flightled flights anyway. that was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough
@united well it is john hughes' birthday. but i will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. gate workers are doing well.
@united - my son left his tablet on plane. am out of country and can not call easily. is there an email to contact?
i will if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united
@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
@united yes supposed to be here by 6pm. i have a board meeting tomorrow. fingers crossed.
@united thanks for not letting me switch flights bc i had a checked bag then cancelled flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hours late flightr!
@united thank you! love united!! have 4 flights today!
@united just did thanks for checking! :)
@united just informed you do not reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting cancelled flightled--thor hates you
@united midland could not get our bags to connect on our intl flight to sydney so have to get em in la &amp; check em in there.
@united this may be the last time i fly your airline.
@united is your company motto: i do not care!!! i heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week. #idonotcare
@united you should tell that to the staff at los angeles then. i boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a gold member. thanks for nothing.
@united missing crew passenger doctor problems frozen toilets and now we're off the plane. give me my money back. ua3466
@united fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from dublin. a jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
@united there was 20 minute to departure no one waiting. on being pressed ground staffer threatened do you want to get to sf today #fail
@united flying los angeles to sfo and system won't let me check in. your site tells me to do it through @aircanada and they tell me through you.
@united and by the way the @virgin and @jetblue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; would not take away a 9year old kids bag!
@united can i just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? i am in heaven now en route to lhr
@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. i am not a grown man but tears happened
@united sure but the plane is an hour late flight! your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
@united ua6002 mli-&gt;den. will miss connection ua3530 den-&gt;yeg due to delay.
@united how come you are the only airline of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. not even gate check...baggage claim?!?
@united i had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from fay was cancelled flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to rdu--reimburse?
@united it is operated by united as it is a heathrow-newark flight
@united yes of course i have. is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
@united can someone assist me with my dm's? waiting 1 hour on phone 2 hours on twitter.
@united flight was overbooked! was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. gate agent switched me over retracted voucher offer.
@united thank you!
@united thanks - it is very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
@united as a million miler i have been delayed plenty. never in the amateurish way@silverairwsys does it. i would be embarrassed to be affiliated.
@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee but they won't honor a lower fare that i found.
@united another delayed united flight. i should not be this surprised or upset. i am mostly disappointed i have to cancelled flight my trip with my dad
@united still cannot direct message it is lh7631 on 21/2/15
@united thank you margo at houston's bush intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
@united i booked our flights w/ @westjet. i saw the same prices each time i searched. it was not the least bit frustrating. #customerservice
@united thanks but i did not want to see 'we've started your flight search over' or 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again
@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour she will be arriving to hawaii after 5 &amp; i won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow 😭
@united i did not my mind was on getting to the next flight.
@united now you've lost my bags too. at least nobody has done anything to help out. this is absurd.
@united what's up with the reduction in e+ on 737-900s? 1k who can no longer confirm e+. forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. now voucher offer doesn’t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. will you step up to the plate flight too?
@united i usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
@united thanks but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1m).
@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. what to do?
@united sweet follow back and i will get the direct message off
@united my reservation were changed so that i can longer make my connecting flight. how can i change this without incurring a fee?
@united all good! next flight was a little delayed so it all worked 👍
@united flight 5431
@united just boarded ua1297 was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience
@united get your act right! you just lost customers because your staff would not let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
@united @shulemstern @gg8929 raise a dispute with your cc provider and they will hopefully clear it for you.
@united held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it did not work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. boo :(
@united nice partners you have. the delays keep increasing every 20 minute @ftlauderdalesun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1ateafnc6r
@united ua1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave denver. #unfriendlyskies
@united yep after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. hope it will be a pleasent one. thanks for your help.
@united just had the worst experience ever flying with you
@united ua1740. as the inbound flight deputy time gets closer you push it back 15 min. you've been doing this for 2 hrs.
@united why is my flight from mke to ordinance getting delayed? our gate attendant is not communicating!
@united my plane sounds like a dj scratching is this normal? if so will this eventually be a new entertainment fee.
@united chase says no referral bonus. thanks.
@united how can i trust united with future flight booking problemss when a confirmed ticketed and purchased ticket is cancelled flightled after the fact?
@united rebooked. this one is late flight too.
@united second late flight flight today
@united if you miss first leg of your flight you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? how much to keep my earned miles?
@united 3586 from iad to buf. incredibly loud and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus. #lowstandards http://t.co/m67wnbglxq
@united cancelled flighting. bought a ticket for a friend but cant get the credit under my name
@united boeing 777 star alliance short finals @heathrowairport 27l on an amazing winters morning #777 #avgeek http://t.co/owmaxoyehz
@united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).
@united i am blown away by stellar #custserv !! thank you &lt;3 http://t.co/jorescfb4x
@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
@united a good start would be to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight is not delayed due to frozen water lines.
@united annnnddddd i am going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
@united you have the nicest gate attendant at newark airport gate 101 right now. multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
@united trade show! come by both 130 for awesome deals on #sunkist and @webbernaturals! $$ http://t.co/1l9scwphph

@united please help! left my ipad air 2 on my flight from new york city to paris yesterday and can’t get in touch with anyone locally. what to do?
@united when will that happen? it really confuses when the first content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward united is.
@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? by the surliness of my united coworkers i am guessing our benefits are not great.
@united i already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. i am speechless at your system
@united just because you are a monopoly in @flysfo does not mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
@united yeah bag is on the way. as per usual. i am actually getting used to getting it delivered to me its kind of nice in a sense.
@united how much is baggage check for international flights?
@united why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new mileageplus premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
@united wonder why people hate dealing with airlines? ridiculous and inflexible policies. i need a phone number and a resolution. now.
@united le2v9d pnr numbered flight. the first leg is cancelled flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. how can i make a reflight booking problems
@united (2/2) it suggests that if cannot confirm certificate at time of flight booking problems i should assume that it may never clear. did not used to be that way
@united thanks for explanation. it seems like an odd incentive structure tho because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs.
@united #sfo #clearvision #tv4u @ united terminal sfo airport http://t.co/q9byn9pctf
2/2 @united you do not really care about our comfort you care about profitability. that's fine just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies
1/2 @united just be honest with your customers. the new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. more rows = more money.
@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
@united designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? the article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
@united what do you think missing meetings is worth? a flight voucher? i fly all the time so what would make it right?
@united and @directtv. not to pile on but it is time to update your in flight tv package. http://t.co/lug4mfvwsa
@united why is it so hard to add in meal preferences after i booked tickets? i forgot to do it &amp; it is now impossible! i even called.
@united it is amazing really.
@united learn to hold connections. they texted me there is another flight late flightr - my connection has not left and were pulling into the gate
@united if i have credit from a flight i cancelled flightled does the new flt have to be booked by 1 year from origination purchase date or flown by that date?
@united this is me and my partners first trip to #nyc i bought the tickets at the same time please seat us next to each other conf# ilc0hp
@united its ridic you cant transfer credit you have my $400 &amp; youre taking $200 of it for cancelled flightling. atleast let me keep the credit damn

@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
@united yes i know that. the question is why is that still the case? #fail
@united there are exit-row window shades in approximately 11% of the windows of your rj-145s. &lt;--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aoeaeszdlx

@united there is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. ua's actions? terrible. # united

@united surprise me. otherwise the flight is over and i do not have a good feeling about your airline.
@united we have been told that it is lost...you guys do not know where it is

@united @gg8929 i am sorry united is not able to keep its word 'cuz their it is totally inadequate but they still says it is a customer fault!
@united how can you not know where my bags are? you knew where they were 6 hours ago. you are killing me! worst service. ever.
@united stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. united airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # united airlines
@united i have received one previously on the 11th having checked. odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
@united okay i have that pretty sure i had it before too but will wait and see what happens....
@united checking tracing information. you got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
@united treats service members like crap never flying again with them #unitedairlines @cnn
@united thanks. ua1121 den 40 minute on tarmac.
@united what is the point of a upc code on checked baggage if you cannot tell me where my luggage is? vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
@united why are your sfo-&gt;bos nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of jetblue and virgin? $179 versus $324. identical times.
@united how come i have no baggage updates.
@united thanks for your response. bags came but it was a long wait and priority tags were not honored at all. disappointing
@united @unitedairlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44zhmfdiw6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
@united hi jh. yes please. since i lost almost a whole day on the way out could you help me change my return for one day late flightr?
@united 3 hours searching for flts find 1 on site &amp; cannot book the $ offered bc 1 segment is not really available. #lies #falseadvertising
@united next flight? do not think i will be spending anymore money with you guys ever. it was that bad.
@united are my bags here yet? they were at palm springs airport. i was at lax. how come i beat my bags here.
@united why could not you have changed the tire of my delayed ua1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
@united a generic form with tons of fields asking for information you already? expected more as a premier platinum. another #servicefail
@united what the fuck is your username and/or email address signin still unavailable? been trying to login since sunday
@united i am flying from msp to dxb my child will turn 2 during the trip do i have to buy a return ticket for my child?
@united i want my bags. there is vital equipment in there. you are royally screwing me. i am cranky and want an update.
@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work
@united flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. i was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
@united i am very disappointed with @silverairways as your partner. no communication 2 extremely late flight flights. really all around horrible.
@united unless it is on you guys im good.
@united are the miles going to be restructured? help a silver status brotha out! i thought i was winning with you guys until today laugh out loud
@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel even for transatlantic flights!
@united missed connection wrong city bags at palm springs but not at hotel. i am seriously tired of being treated this way.
@united where are my bags!!! they were not in los angeles like your promised. 9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
@united dang... i thought i was in a teleportation device! ua514
@united received my bag. i appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
@united still have not received a response. please direct message me for my contact information.
@united i have been waiting on my bag in iah for 45mins. they're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags. fix this!!
@united so if this game was the one reason i payed for @directv is there something we could work out here? http://t.co/hqdtk6atue
@united :take note of this great example of @jetblue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3gnk2n7ld
@united rtb&gt;iah 2/17 first class. my wife (global services) and i had headaches due to our neighbors smoking e cigarettes. contact me please
@united federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag...yet you lose our bag and that's okay
@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
@united hello. just wondering how long it might take for turkish airlines flights to show up in my united miles. thanks.
@united do you guys have any working planes?
@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... how about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
@united again you said to go take the time to go there knowing what the issue was and knowing you won’t fix it.
@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. this business traveler is never flying you again!
@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from chicago to toronto. the plane came within feet of colliding another plane and is stopped.
@united that made me so mad but then i called the bag number and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)
@united yes. it was the airport person who told me the bag was still in nashville when i filed the claim. (1/2)
@united the only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
@united ugh. my bags were sent to palm springs and not to los angeles as promised. they better be at the hotel when i get there.
@united direct messaged you did not hear anything back
@united yup it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months
@united great thank you!! i will send it now.
@united so who does handle bag issues? and why would not you put me onto them in the first place?
@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
@united returned from vacation + went to luggage services. golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
@united holiday of a lifetime to new york ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
@united my golf bag did not have a top cover + staffers said they could not check without a type of cover or wrap. forced to leave the bag...
@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in heathrow?
@united once again my bag is lost when i travel united!!!! please do something
@united @annricord both!
@united stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. any updates please? this happened on way to newark and now again to lhr...
@united - flight 1114. unfortunately this is not an isolate flightd incident. i have not waited less than 20min in years
@united did i mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with year poor replacement on icy mtn roads
@united this is in your hemispheres magazine. i am open to what will you do to make the flight more pleasant. http://t.co/vrqdpqepfw
@united hard to believe since your staff @ sfo checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to ewr the same day.
@united it is late flight... i am tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. i was not chipper but i definitely was not rude.
@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting then yelled bc i took pic. put me stdby when seat. difference agent gave me seat 30min late flightr. platinum
@united i am a frequent user. congrats you only lost my bags once in 20 years. problem it was today and your staff were rude!😢 still no bag!
@united sivi stewart at los angeles was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport. much thanks!
@united yes though they have not located the bag yet. it was a lovely flight outside of that.
@united got me home amid snow &amp; cancelled flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. thank you!
@united my wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days with no result.
@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? good to know
@united #unitedairlines fill out form and never receive response? i expect remedy. we can travel another airline and cancelled flight as members w u.
@united 12/13ewr-lax ua1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.fa filed report who to chat with for partial refund?
@united so you told me to go knowing what the issue was only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it?
@united so i made it all the way to the airport and they say they won’t fix the handle. i showed you this problem and you said to go…?
@united this link in your tweet goes to someone's internal email -&gt; http://t.co/zksx79itdn...... probably one of your third party it contracts
@united then why do you bother responding? your customer service is the worst. never using you guys again.
@united 618 was flight out of houston
@united free hotel does not make up for such poor customer service and disregard
@united it is messed up to refuse to wait 10 minute after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
@united mechanical delay occurred in houston earlier today re: their flight to ordinance
@united 374 ordinance to roc. family came to see me at sna. i am a member so is my dad. he used his miles for them.
cc @dadboner #boldflavors “@united: we’re bringing bourbon st. to 35000 ft. with bold flavors fresh ingredients and more dining options
@united thanks for checking in. never got through via phone. on hold over hour. how long is too long to wait on hold? ugh. #csfail
@united is there a referral program for the milageplus explorer card?
@united how else would i know it was denied?
@united obviously
@united hours on the phone...hung up on...all i want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
@united i sent an email describing my experience. looking forward to a follow up to hopefully make it right.
@united be chicago's hometown airline care about your neighbors #savethediagonals #flyquiet #ordnoise
@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.

@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. excellent customer service. name fits.
@united how about changing rno -den non-stop in may (9) from 6am to late flight morning or early afternoon?
@united #unitedairlines wont wait 10min for family w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today
@united i can’t go back to the airport i’m working and won’t have time. are you telling me there is seriously no other way?
@united instead of bourbon street how about #quiet #planes #savethediagonals
@united 3875 to denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
@united i have been doing this for 15 years and i have never had this many issues with any other airline.
@united haha that's fine. still won't fly @united ever again. seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. unreal
@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - roc. you can make up 10 minute in air but instead of waiting you leave early
@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. great customer service.
@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ordinance only needed to wait 10 minute for them. refused and left early instead. what the fuck
@united captain we apologize for the delay the company is looking for an open gate (glance starboard side see 5 open gates)
@united reinstating the kosher meals that were dropped shortly after the merger?
@united i am on one of your 757-300 between jfk and lax.when are you upgrading planes?plane has no screenslousy seats and that's in unitedfirst.
@united is it possible to upfare to pence a segment where i have a gpu waitlisted?
@united bringing your a game with premium cabin dining. nice! https://t.co/zgoqoxjbqy
@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
@united fair enough but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff
@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
@united you guys suck. you delay flights but cannot hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #worstairlineever
@united i want a plane dad
@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the tarmac moments i love you united
@united it was an international flight and we did not get our new estimated time of arrival until we were in the air.
@united - i think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. things got considerably better. thanks!
@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. it really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. hello @delta !
@united useless response. i need a functioning wheelchair not a customer care form to fill out.
@united awesome. thx. and thanks for replying so damn fast sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!
@united what does cabin functionality mean when i am taking a customer satisfaction survey?
@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. reimburse?
@united @gg8929 unbelievable hypocrisy!!
@united thanks for not getting my businessfirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at ewr despite a 2+ hour layover. nice job
@united amazing flying over 25000 miles on #unitedairlines &amp; alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere
@united on top of this a csr went ahead and hung up on me after i called united to discuss this.
@united now finally in memphis. landed 30 minutes ago. still no bags. paying for a service that just gets worse...
@united thanks for a terrible experience at ewr. customers should be treated as a priority not as an inconvenience #tryagain
@united some third party service known as ezee flights. a man who confirmed he was born in india told me his name was steve wilson.
@united the third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0pyxqv5
@united she met me from customer service at the arrival of flight ua3787 pvd-iad. thanks you guys have really handled this storm!
@united ooh thanks!
@united my flight was at 1 pm. still at the airport gee what service. do they care nope. delayed until 7:55.
@united very disappointed in cc. purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. would not hold price after refund. unacceptable
@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. it does not state a passport must always be also presented. read it
@united we were told by united to carry over/carry back for the refund.
@united no i had to leave for work. would have not been possible. so i would love to have this replaced now
i feel completely cheated @united. i read your commitment to customer service via website and definitely did not get service suggested there.
@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
@united it-problems with the link? #3thparty
@united: i feel very well informed. yes the flight is indeed delayed. thank you. http://t.co/fuchzrzjg5
@united why do i pay more for coach plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
@united can i get some help changing a ticket. 40 minutes on hold and counting....
@united thanks for all the help! totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
@united was told by supervisor that united disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
@united your mileageplus signup page is broken.
@united $7 for wifi just so i can tell my family i am gonna be late flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
@united fyi: continuous texts and emails i am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
@united so not only were you late flight you broke my luggage handle. you paying for a new one? http://t.co/nyvv1x3d67
@united: no friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in sfo followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #nofun
@united once again your customer service rep was rude! i asked a question and in turn got attitude. jane was no help. disgusted again!
@united can you not see the thread?
@united poor old united: never seem to get the response right :)
@united obviously the staff at ewr - united or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being friendly and helpful #ewr worst airport
@united also why cannot i pre-select seats on sfo-&gt;yyz flight? i am a canadian flight booking problems on http://t.co/azltjhf7lv.
@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare &amp; seats?
@united thanks! :)
hypocrisy retweet @united @gg8929 i am sorry we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^kp
@united i should not have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. the weather being something completely out of my control
@united eventually. you should approach bags like @alaskaair they get it.
@united what if my new york city flight is delayed and i miss my connection to sacramento from chicago?
@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days late flightr no refund.
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? not convinced your company is safe for flt.
@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 minute b/f call disconnected.
@united if your policy changed you must advise at the time of purchase. same if you choose to vary it by airport! we want a full refund!!
@united wanted to but you cancelled flightled my tickets.... they were too special i guess even for united.
@united i am 0/3 for flight booking problems without major problems. 0% is not bad!👎👎
@united @el_ingeniero do not check your baggage if you do not have to. they will lose it!
@united i am hoping we do not miss our los angeles - ito connection. not looking forward to being stuck at los angeles overnight with our team....again!
@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated. we travel between canada &amp; usa on united with only nexus
@united how can you not know after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded the planes weight?!
@united you make it hard to fly with you. delayed over an hour and now the plane is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
@united serious firing needs to happen at hnl. they broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bt37kyrbyj
@united call customer service and of course they just say theres nothing we can do and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line.
@united now submitted for the third time please check and confirm receipt. have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. thanks
@united if our already rescheduled flight is cancelled flightled is our hotel room paid for?
@united classic
@united elizabeth at washington dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! i am super pleased!
@united thanks!
@united does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a premium cabin?
@united flight ua3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
@united a third party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. excellent service united is offering.
@united no thanks
@united yesterday i am sorted now.
@united thanks for that advice so helpful. cannot believe you guys actually charge people to fly united
@united if you have had any issues with united airlines please retweet. paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
@united @gg8929 so why did you cancelled flight tickets for thousands of people when you did not like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
@united do you have an e-mail address i can write my account to? might be less likely to disappear
@united so i wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you did not receive how do i know this won't happen this time?
@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr 02.27.2015 737-300.
@united stuck here in iah waiting on flight 253 to honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. could we have gotten a new plane!?!? fail
@united @unitedappeals @gg8929 what kind of hypocrisy is that? only cancelled flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
@united no. the entire problem here is that i was never sent anything via email and only given a flight booking problems number over the phone.
@united calling that number was useless. heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
@united they could not get me first class on any of their flights so i just rebooked myself.
@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
@united i will be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter. united airlines should be ashamed.
@united hidden city forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. your support cannot fix. :-(
@united jt thanks for your help i’ll complete the form once we are back home
@united missed it. incoming on time then sat for 30 then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...
@united @gg8929 ladies and gents - united airlines...
@united you might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
@united allright! last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. does that include economy plus cabin?
@united well it is la and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark palm springs technically. maybe i will get bumped to first class den to phl on friday:)
@united yes still need assistance i do not have a flight home due to change in flight you made i miss all connections !
@united i believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a direct message
@united thanks! we would like an apology and a full refund. please confirm when we will receive.
@united hi can you email me here so i can share the details? thanks. frank@postsecret.com
@united but i got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. please can you refund without penalty.
@united you're just using automated responses and do not have the decency to actually care/respond
@united jt the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
@united here i was thinking how i could say so many nice things after getting upgraded but then you delayed my flight... it is ok!
@united can you explain how it rewards us elite premiere 1k members?
@united for our birthdays my fiancé &amp; i want to travel late flight april. you're our fave airline but frontier has this: http://t.co/uaywrr45as :-/
@united i’m resending the confirmation code in a direct message
@united i did direct message the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
@united airlines' Chief Executive Officer jeff smisek: disloyal to loyal workers http://t.co/0cevy3p42b via @huffpostbiz
@united the guidelines say 10x9x17 my bag is 20x15.7x8.7 so it is a bit taller than the guidelines. is that gonna be a problem?
@united thank you! i wish the lady in little rock had told me that in the morning when i asked her
@united no claim number. have not been back to iad baggage since. is there a phone i can call to speak to someone?
@united do you think there will problems at newark nj on saturday due to expected snow?
@united got it. i am following the united page.
@united thank you for the speedy response! i figured it may be something of that nature. you guys and your fine print haha
@united worst service ever 😈
@united thanks for your attention. i would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at dca. what is my best option?
@united cannot believe united cannot find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. loved united but debating choice
@united i am furious. you're firm is a disgrace. despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. all alone at night # united
@united holy high speed internet batman! speeds at united club at iad are insanely fast! thanks
@united your website flight booking problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
@united @mrandyep like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? creative!
@united flt 4487 is having some major delays bc ground crew was so slow. the flight crew has been terrific. been 2 hours on the ground..😡...
@united sorry i hate united. i won't get to see my family until thursday
@united thanks for the timely service &amp; great staff getting my wife and me to and from cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
@united done just now thanks.
@united currently on standby to los angeles then it is a 2 hour ride to palm springs. long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
@united your customer service for mileage plus customers is a disgrace. i just spent 45 minute on the phone to reset a pin number with no luck
@united no i do not. i was only given a flight booking problems reference number.
@united all these changes. way to stick it to your premiere 1k loyal customers. why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
@united thanks for the offer but i finally made it to my destination albeit hours late flight.
@united airlines cancelled flights oc fll #flight today. $700 to switch. no notice no apology. we are done flying #unitedairlines.
@united can you send me another confirmation email?
@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
@united i travel a lot and i get it. you're still my fave but ewr to cleveland w/40 minute layover to connect to dc = our best option? come on.
@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience i was expecting very disappointed.
@united airlines cancelled flights oc fll #flight today. $700 to switch. no notice no apology. done flying #unitedairlines.
@united sorry wrong link for the bag : http://t.co/pzal4wtrez thats the one i meant
@united flight 86 lax-iad back rows not cleaned prior to boarding. how gross is that to find used tissues in your seat? please.
@united thank you! 😊
@united take a lesson from @virginamerica they know how to treat customers!
@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere i have flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@virginamerica asks their customer what they want
@united customer service 👎
@united priceless. united stranded my daughter at o'hare. united did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # united air
@united hi again any updates here?
@united could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/u390czplhl
@united 3359 which you finally cancelled flightled.
.@united what link? those are all the email offers you sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.the last 1 just expired http://t.co/zzps5ywve2
@united thanks finally made it.. missed meetings but what can i do now?
@united our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. this is the second time this has happened
@united supposedly they're out for delivery. i will believe it when i see it.
@united thank you. yes i was hoping to speak with someone directly but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)
@united sure did! only waited about 15min. yay!
@united hi jh my experience with united has been entirely disgusting but yes i would like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.
@united took this picture on thursday. #awesome http://t.co/ivgpzsjtkw
@united probably would not be doing it had someone returned my call or email. case number 8273993
@united i cannot even fit my name on the first two lines yes... please do pass on feedback. this is a big downgrade from previous years.
is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #united #mileageplus miles with discount? many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqzlg
@united no it was 2 flight cancelled flightlations (one due to weather one mechanical) paid own hotel bag held in transfer. no voucher/compensation
@united i got email that my reservations got cancelled flightled and i will be refunded. nothing got refunded as of yet
@united so what do you offer now that my flight was cancelled flighted and i am stranded away from home and work?
@united you are really trying me today.
@united looks like i am settled in to where i am going. thx.
@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
@united no they were to busy taking to each other and i needed to get to an audition.
@united was never given one
@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service i was expecting
@united stuck in iad going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from nashville that you cannot tell when it will arrive?!! ridiculous!!
@united flt 4567 no gate agent no announcements. so unprofessional. time to go back to @delta
@united thanks ^kp. please also mention the quiche breakfast and tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly first class.
@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. why do not you figure out a solution and announce once?
@united bags are still in houston since friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
@united who can tell me where they are?
@united flight 4567 have already been cancelled flightled once been trying to get home two days. staff being very unhelpful.
@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants do not even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. pilots came out looking for her. went to charge her personal phone which she would been txting on
@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
@united i do not see how i need to spend an extra $100 bc of your equipment failure.
@united i do not need to make any changes. i reserved my seats when i bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no computer seats
@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to california? seriously? this is why airlines are failing!! pathetic!
@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so i did not miss my transfer...
@united no not received any e-mails in either inbox or junk/spam
@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department? we have submitted our claim through email without success.
@united i am not this person but i have been sitting in denver for three hours and all i want to do is get on a plane. please let me go home.
@united flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
@united i just need to get to ric tonight. i have been in ewr for 24hrs now.
@united which is why my next flights to miami will be on another airline.
@united it is super frustrating that the folks at the united ticket counter in pittsburg are not honoring their own media rate! #unitedfail
@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. ua469 from den to ewr. how long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
@united what is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
@united with karen and found her unhelpful and rude called united at the time &amp; told she could board but karen would not accept
@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. karen was rude untrained and unhelpful i also spoke
@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air car or boat she can travel with only nexus.
@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
@united 1 refused boarding with nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
@united on a good note the 2 employees i encountered @ newark were fabulous. i was very late flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!
@united you lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? does that make sense to you? and yes i already called cust svc. they said no.
@united you all tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! i hate little planes!!!
@united doing a good thing holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on late flight connecting flight. we'll still make destination on time
@united q: just purchased ticket to #hawaii for trip in late flight-march. does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
@united stay warm - i will be passing through chicago next week
@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5imdckodfx is broken.i get a time out error.
@united @ny_njairports only at newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
@united giving up on your direct flight from iah to honolulu. third attempt in 3 years - third delay. $7 meal voucher. wow. customer service!
@united just played the most bizarre safety video i have ever seen... http://t.co/hlm2oks6xl
@united nearly 48 hours late flightr and still no idea where it is. i will never fly united again if i can help it.
@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. had same outage on 1618 on friday. how can southwest get it right on every plane but united can't?
@united wifi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and late flightncy) to recent @gogo experiences.
@united second day &amp; attempt trying to leave iad &amp; i am on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. over an hour delayed!
@united is there a direct number to call to request a refund? its telling me its not valid as i changed the ticket. no number on site
@united when is my plane coming? been delayed for almost 7 hours. no plane.
@united not fast enough. no excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. southwest has wifi. this is awful.
@united thankful for great service in newark. seats fixed and i was seated with my daughter! fabulous landing in fort myers!
@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. we're on our way to nrt and the gate refused to upgrade. a platinum. blegh
@united is late flight again. everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew. really!
@united miserable trip ... lost bag sat... found mon... lost again... shipping second day ground tues... might have it for return flight home
@united spending the afternoon @ missing in action not your fault. no lounge? very inconvenient.
@united costumer service sucks! waiting for a week for a response
@united i somehow think i am going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in denver without winter clothes on my dime. i guess we'll see.
@united i normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. maybe planes should have a kid section (near the back) ;)
@united of course i need help. i have been dming you ladies and gents all day. your only solution is hope for the best and lax.
@united confirmation number: njv4bp - all i need is email confirmation of flight from new york city - sfo february 4
@united is changing its #mileageplus program: winners and losers http://t.co/38otlzak5d #airline #travel #loyalty #rewards
@united brandi zabsonre in denver deserves a raise for bringing delight into a terrible travel situation. big ups http://t.co/tk3aopdtsq
@united thank you!!!!! and next flight to durango then driving to farmington new mexico for work! but hitting the slopes in durango!
@united i was denied use of a rear facing car seat on ua5025 an erj145. can you confirm the actual policy?
@united you better hold my flight to tucson #5237 just landed in houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem
thx! stand by! “@united: @rajuchinthala i know it is frustrating and i do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^jh”
@united roundtrip tickets to nj are dramatically cheaper through virgin pretty pricey via united. can you match them?
@united dropped off a luggage at iad over 2 months ago for repair from damages have not heard anything about it since when do i get it back?
@united that's what i thought! thanks for the clarification!
@united feck guys. stop cancelled flightling flights from ewr to ric the weather is fine i both locations!!!
@united + ua has been rolling out improvements too we think. hoping they'll catch up soon? meantime ana is our preference!
@united @flyana_official pleasantly surprised to find ana has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights planes and service
@united step 1: cancelled flight flight. step 2: do not notify customer. step 3: charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. brilliant.
@united i need my confirmation number! can you give it to me?
@united + besides no small degree of self-interest. we take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation.
.@united we rebooked. but @casleah and i had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? frustrating.
@united no worries about the tweets. we all should do what we can to make sure we as in your tag line fly the friendly skies.
@united @jsumiyasu i am thankful to the united ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. home late flight is still home!
@united i appreciate the follow up.
@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
@united by the way is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +
@united no but you cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
@united sat at airport for 5 hours still sitting at gate.. sigh
@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. she did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
@united gold star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but cannot accommodate me until a much late flightr arrival time-not happy!
@united all day travel. #swag #ijustwanttosleep
@united thank you for the new club at o'hare. very comfortable. you made the difficult weather days proficient and enjoyable.
@united filled in the form you sent the link to on 29.1.15 and then either 9 or 10.2.15
@united did not let me get on the iah-hnl direct. now weather delay for my sfo leg. stop being reactive and be proactive!
@united bad coffee but the juice is ok. #getphilz @ united terminal sfo airport http://t.co/sg7iqqfvso
@united why am i mot getting my refund?
.@united nothing apparently. i have flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
@united did not get her name. she was not in our group. she was sitting behind us. think it was window seat #40? we only overheard...
@united you know what the united club needs? power. moar power. insufficient outlets for the #roadwarrior (ord)
@united thrilled to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when i boarded last...
@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #employeerelations
@united - ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn iah and sfo. no power ports no wifi no personal entertainment. torture
@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch forgot to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
@united broken entertainment system on my 8 hour new york city flight terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless
@united how much does it cost to check in an additional bag? traveling from newark to glasgow. thank you :)

@united and do not hope for me having a nicer flight some other time try to do things right. you sold me those tickets with that connetion
@united the we got into the gate at iah on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. if you know people is arriving have to wait
@united yes. we waited in line for almost an hour to do so. some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.

@southwestair thank you. great customer service so far. accidents happen i understand. hopefully everything works out.
@southwestair my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
@southwestair opened online applications for fall 2015 intern positions throughout the company. apply via https://t.co/gml7ot3imh
@southwestair honesty should always be the policy

@southwestair it is not fun having a delay from nashville to las vegas but the crew at the gate c9 desk has been awesome! #patience #luvswa
@southwestair thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hours on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. really?
never got to the strip that fast before. stoked for special @imaginedragons show tonight! thanks again @southwestair! http://t.co/topqmvqnjp
@southwestair the problem is apologies do not help. results matter and it is proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.

@southwestair still there? i was posted up in downtown waiting for y'all. on my way!
@southwestair like kelsey said really bad spot for locals. do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?

@southwestair right? we're delayed so i am crabby. :) also why do you allow one family member to purchase earlybird check in and hold rows?
@southwestair really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book.
@southwestair: grrrrrr i need a flight there first! maybe for my bday next month...
@southwestair luv! your new luv television commercials. traveled on your airline last year return trip from nyc...#feltthelove

@southwestair just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. class act. i appreciate that!
@southwestair @fox8news serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle. but for real you should fire @kristi_capel
@southwestair i appreciate the response but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
@southwestair how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
@southwestair done. sorry i thought i was already.
@southwestair i can. does not it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats we should need to fit in them?
@southwestair your terry is our hero! got my husband back through security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in austin. terry #85832 you rock!

@southwestair i am in let us do this!
@southwestair you completely let me down tonight. your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. how sad for you (&amp; me.)
@southwestair you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@southwestair kudos to your rep patricia at gate b11 this sunday morning at #chicago #midway #mdw… http://t.co/mmcwkqp2gy

@southwestair just reading your boarding policy we're a group of 8 travellers with kids ranging from 3-10 is it possible to sit together?
@southwestair you're right i do. i have been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. making for a long night.
@southwestair @jparkermastin customer service has been very passive in their response. disappointed. i have only flown sw but am rethinking
@southwestair broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. they told her it is not their problem. calling the a list preferred line now.
@southwestair is this a joke? my return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! new record from you guys 💔😪
@southwestair nbd i was able to figure out a workaround. just wanted to help. got my bags less than 24 hours late flightr. muchas grassy ass.
@southwestair luggage delivery between 1-4am? really? after i was told by midnight multiple times? why lie? crazy and bad business.
.@southwestair thanks for the follow up. just sent direct message
@southwestair now i do not get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
@southwestair thank you for your consideration!
@southwestair apologies are whatever. please just deliver the bags like you said you would. feel like employees are lying to me.
@southwestair what robot is running this account. the same one that does not remember anything they ask. same conversation over and over.
@southwestair it was never really lost it was put on another flight with my knowledge we just were not sure what flight but i have it - ty!
@southwestair crew of wn3946 san-sfo was brilliant! rita was hilarious. i know i have been down on you before but this was a great flight
@southwestair is not being responding to the @specialolympics athletes. #notcool #southwest

@southwestair i am flying out of cun tomorrow to den - can i change my flight due to the travel advisory??
@southwestair tough i can take. zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. looking for signs you care abt cust.
@southwestair do not apologize. do something about it. words mean nothing. actions work. eom.
@southwestair after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. not happy 😣
@southwestair how long does it take for my rapid rewards points to be credited to my account?
@southwestair why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
@southwestair we're pulling off the runway now! making new friends with seat mates. thanks for the response cb.
@southwestair but to make us tru to find space in other flights. this customer service is as bad as @spiritairlines.
@southwestair no delay. i pay $777.70 for bs a1 ticket. you boarded flight early. i am last to board. now have middle seat. wasted $$$$!
@southwestair first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not cancelled flight it earlier then very amateurish that there was no plan.
@southwestair very disappointed in your handling of tonight's cancelled flighted dallas flight. not that it was cancelled flighted but no contingencies.
@southwestair it is ok! southwest is still the best airline around! just hate when baggage room runs out.. my now checked bag has headphones!

@southwestair i live in the southwest imagine dragons is my favorite band and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them. it would be amazing +
@southwestair longer flights with 300 series no wifi? will be great when you retire them.
@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on swa flights is now the norm rather than the exception. is this being addressed?
@southwestair yes thank you. just sent dm.
@southwestair when is the last chance to get #destinationdragons tickets? i would die of happiness if i won 😭🙏
@southwestair the in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. and the fact that the wifi only works on one device is sort of sad.
@southwestair the sign in screen had major mobile issues the responsive design was not working properly my nexus 5.
@southwestair sure did. also read on there that southwest does not believe it is liable for the incident. how is it my fault that sw lost it?
@southwestair what's up with the new in-flight wifi service? super crappy user experience. miss the old provider. :(
@southwestair it is too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
@southwestair can you please follow so i can dm? thx!

@southwestair it was the usually excellent swa flight!
@southwestair you know i ❤️you but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from tpa to pdx but stuck w u. turned my 3 hours in mci to 6
@southwestair i figured the streaming would not work per the tos but just the @nascar site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
@southwestair now we have to wait and wait to get it straight. i fly you for personal and business. but now not so sure. #bebetter
@southwestair because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. this messed up the passenger log.
@southwestair your #android wi-fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! i cannot get to @nascar or mrn for @disupdates #budweiserduels
@southwestair dear swa i fly you a lot. most of the time amazing. today: unacceptable.i am sitting here in midway delayed 20 min....
@southwestair what do you know? finally lined up like cattle to board my sw flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice
@southwestair seems like you could make more money by opening up seats on a more desirable flight.
@southwestair jason (108639) at gate #3 in san made my afternoon!!! #southwestairlines #stellarservice #thanks!

@southwestair i have a roundtrip ticket now and i need to change one leg of the trip (to a nearby airport) - not possible via website?
@southwestair please do something about the speed of your wifi connections on your planes. it might as well be non-existent.
@southwestair your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. god bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
@southwestair weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. over it.
@southwestair is seriously the worst. i do not remember the last time i or someone i knew had a flight that was not delayed / cancelled flightled / etc!
@southwestair is there any way to get entry to the las vegas event to see @imaginedragons perform? #destinationdragons
@southwestair...give the crew of swa 4007 a high five from this av-8b guy for its nice xw landing into @bostonlogan. nicely done!
@southwestair why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available? does not make sense to me.

@southwestair do not worry you will! :-)
@southwestair yes. please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. i should not be receiving different 411 evrytime i call
@southwestair never got any notification that flight 955 was cancelled flighted today. correct phone # and email on file. not a happy customer.
@southwestair i was just sitting here talking at a technology conference about how awesome you guys are and this rolled across. luv you guys! #lol
@southwestair do you have any flights from nas-bwi ton march 23?
@southwestair for my travel i see bz class and get away are sld out. anytime is available . how do i know how many anytime are available?
@southwestair thanks i get that. it looks like all bwi-sjd services stops after august 7. is that the case? i cant find one date with flights.
@southwestair can i get some luv with a fallow?
@southwestair thanks for your attention i have been flying southwest for 3 years and have not had this issue in the past.

@southwestair suggestion- shades on the windows @kciairport so travelers won't have to watch your luggage handlers throwing their bags around
@southwestair please help me get tickets to the @imaginedragons club show in atlanta?! #destinationdragons
@southwestair do you perhaps have a pair to the atlanta show? #prettyplease
@southwestair your a-list program is a complete joke! your company does not value loyal customers.time to look for another go-to airliner
@southwestair what's with the pricing cache?! about to book a flight refreshed the page &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. ridiculous. 😑
@southwestair @imaginedragons #destinationdragons any tix to spare? i wanna go see the show on friday in la with my friend @hayleymad!
@southwestair a-list preference credit card holder called exclusive # and hung up after on hold for 14 min. what gives???
@southwestair #destinationdragons @imaginedragons i am a huge fan! i would love tix to your show!
@southwestair following!! my bad.
@southwestair is your bwi-sjd service seasonal? was not part of extension. called intl desk. they did not know. want to fly in september on sat.
@southwestair scott is the best!!! thank yo from the bottom of my heart💕#destinationdragons with friends in la @hayleymad see you friday
@southwestair why must the 4:45pm nonstop bos-bna flight stop running after august 7???
@southwestair now flying non stop cmh-oak has me daydreaming about a trip to the bay...especially in this weather. #ohioprobz
@southwestair 3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. also no origami in the magazine. new policies? #oldpolicieswaybetter
@southwestair is awful. they have lost my bag and are not providing any info. this is day 3 and nothing. #worstairlineever
@southwestair if this flight is cancelled flighted or delayed any further i expect full compensation for my park ticket hotel &amp; flight..
@southwestair yeehaw. you found us another plane. thanks for listening to me vent.
@southwestair there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be flight booking problems southwest again..
@southwestair and your costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. it is scheduled for 455
@southwestair not to mention i now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. you've ruined my trip. i am not happy and want compensation.
@southwestair you need to get your act together. you new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. yet i have been delayed 3 times ..
@southwestair @brittanyobx11 keeping families apart w/ your quirky archaic policies. any other airline accommodates in this situation.
@southwestair report was filed but would like to support some active searching. feels pretty passive now. information on computer is precious.
@southwestair surprise surprise more delays. seems to be the norm. broken down equipment.
@southwestair this is unbelievable... thank you so much! #destinationdragons
@southwestair amazing c/s today by sw thank you so very much. this is the reason we fly you #southwest
@southwestair is the best airline out there no one is better than them #onelove #southwest #bestairline
@southwestair great cabin and flight crew this morning on #578. a great smile and happy staff are signs of a happy company. thanks.
@southwestair thank you for always going above and beyond with your customer service!!!!!! #favoriteairline #luvforsw #southwestair
@southwestair yes can do
@southwestair why does not mean tsa precheck show up on my mobile boarding pass? my ktn is linked to my account.
@southwestair great news for @portcolumbuscmh today. finally columbus' top unserved market will have flights.
@southwestair no flights to hrl :( is this a limited route?
@southwestair is really stepping up their service🐩 http://t.co/vqtyza6mzu
@southwestair this inflight wifi is the absolute worst. i would be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds... #flight7
@southwestair are there any flights from msp to hrl in march? i am looking at 3/19-3/23
@southwestair yes i know that. also noticed you offer a list boarding after a60. so your programs are too popular.
@southwestair i pay for a service to be delivered. whether or not it is your fault should not there be some sort of compensation?
@southwestair a little surprised my early bird got me b15 from den to kc just now. worst i have had. what's up?
@southwestair again please accept my apologies for my lame childish tweet. you did not deserve that &amp; i remain a loyal sw customer!
@southwestair i owe you an apology. my tweet was out of frustration not constructive criticism. i am a sw fan &amp; love your service!
@southwestair would not it be awesome for my first time flying to be #destinationdragons?!
@southwestair ..just booked trip to cancun...❤️ no baggage fees..but need to have more flight time options
@southwestair thank you!!! #bringbacktheluvtordu #miami #directflights
@southwestair i can easily get to the atlanta show i just need tickets help?!
@southwestair got duped w/ a connection on first flight (sneaky) now you won't give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. shameful
@southwestair that would be great. thank you! i will send it over when you follow.
@southwestair real sincere apology! makes my day! glad to know flying mail is more important than me. never flying sw again! #badservice
@southwestair i already follow you and cannot direct message because you need to follow me back
@southwestair my direct message won't go through but it is 261633561838. please let me know if you need anything else.
@southwestair can someone rebook me? please direct message me.
@southwestair rude customer svc won't accommodate an earlier flight w/o $400 charge. us mail takes priority over customers. #badservice
@southwestair rude gate agent. wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. think this will be our last time on sw.
@southwestair having trouble reflight booking problems a cancelled flighted flight. no one picking up phones and your site is not working.
@southwestair @fortunemagazine love sw forever😃💕😍⤴⤴
@southwestair please hire an efficiency consultant to manage your phx baggage checkin. way to many open kiosks with 100's of people waiting

@southwestair @fortunemagazine friendliest employees
@southwestair i got a phishing email claiming to be from southwest. i can forward to you if you'd like to investigate.
@southwestair unfortunately no it is my lack of status that's the big problem. my company policy forces me to buy the cheapest tickets
@southwestair every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is full. still hard to believe. fly 8 hours through atl?no
@southwestair @fortunemagazine superb choice - swa. i am a raving fan. they even take stress out of weather-relate flightd glitches! #custexp
@southwestair has 22 employees on social care team 4 staff the listening ctr. at any time-rest of spots filled by other areas. #ragandisney
@southwestair listening center is open seating just like on their planes. #ragandisney
@southwestair @jlittle100 double up with this comment. phl to anywhere south florida is gone gone gone. hello us air
@southwestair . i do not like the new schedule. no more nonstops from phl to fll or pbi? we are not free to move between those cities. sad.
@southwestair incredibly frustrating. i emailed but still have not received a response.
@southwestair i paid for inflight wifi only for it not to work. download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; i ended up watching the free tv instead.
@southwestair sure can! just a second.
@southwestair oh my god thank you so much!!! i just sent you a direct message
@southwestair i wish i would've known so i could've slept 2 hours more and let my friend know not to wait for me after she lands...
@southwestair thank you for the prompt response. i will email late flightr today.
thanks to @southwestair i get to go to the #destinationdragons @imaginedragons show this weekend in utah @velourlive !!! #thankyou

@southwestair @fortunemagazine love you southwest. you've always been helpful. when i traveled a lot w/my son infant/toddler you were great!
@southwestair @fortunemagazine love flying southwest! best flight attendants ever!
@southwestair nothing express about your express bag drop at phoenix sky harbor
@southwestair is it possible to book a refundable trip? willing to pay extra. this would be for a domestic round trip flight
@southwestair used to exclusively fly sw but late flightly direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched. 😔 why...so... few...direct...flights?
@southwestair would you be willing to help me surprise my bestfriend with tickets to go see @imaginedragons? #destinationdragons gracias!
@southwestair mac computer left on bwi to la flight on 14th. reward for recovery; information important to owner.#help #passengers #honesty

“@jetblue: our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vxn2j36m7v” this happened
@jetblue - definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
@jetblue but the 4 hour policy- when i called and they said i did not report it soon enough. what would have changed if i had noticed sooner?
@jetblue - hopefully that will help someone in the future. would there have been a different procedure if i had discovered the theft sooner?
@jetblue - i did that as soon as i realized. will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? security cameras? anything?
@jetblue - i did but since i was stranded in syr without a ride i missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
@jetblue absolutely no worries. i am just never flying with you again. ever. even i have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople
@jetblue dont lose my luggage!!!
@jetblue you just directed me to your mobile website. where is the direct link? get it together!
@jetblue if i had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. i would i have lost my job at this point!!!
@jetblue i understand why your doing it. but for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. relax b4 flight etcetera. advocate notice maybe??

alright @jetblue.... done! alternatively if you'd like to charter a private jet for me to pitt i will gladly accept :)
@jetblue great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. too bad we're at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags.

@jetblue i believe it is irina. on the flip-side super disappointed that eatup cafe is not available on this bos --&gt; sfo flight today.
@jetblue all good i just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 i might be on a horse &amp; buggy. so what's a little delay right.
@jetblue good to know thanks so much!
@jetblue unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. missed dinner

@jetblue called jb 3 times!everytime auto vmsg:your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins waited longer than 18 mins and no answer!

@jetblue i would like the actual email address so i can follow up. thank you.
@jetblue ...and when did your legal department start running your social media channels?
@jetblue nope. the regular line was multi-x faster. you literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as ems.
@jetblue sounds fun! how does that work?
@jetblue thanks! calling right now!
@jetblue thank you but that is not really responding to my request is it? you are sending me into a generic environment on your site.
@jetblue i know there's no actual 'mile high' club but surely there's something i can join ;-)
@jetblue hello! my husband bought us a trip last night &amp; just noticed my last name is misspelled! what can i do? thanks!

@jetblue will you cancelled flight tonight's 7 pm out of dfw to bos? #weather
@jetblue haha. thanks. you guys are great. unlike the @nyjets. ;-) #gopatriots!
@jetblue thanks
@jetblue it was booked through work but added upgrade on seat. need the upgrade receipt.
@jetblue understood but i watched as family heading to fl was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. i am speaking at conference in sf
@jetblue thank you for the free flyfi!! makes an already great airline even better! #jetblue #boston #westpalmbeach #flybetter
@jetblue what's the easiest way to get a ticket receipt? can i get one at check in or can i get one online? thanks!
@jetblue thank you!!
@jetblue any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. chasing points is no fun
@jetblue i tried! had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. ended up flight booking problems united for $$$ am so upset
@jetblue keeps getting better. no water on the plane.
.@jetblue that's what i planned on but boston traffic due to recent weather was insane! if i had been expedited i would have made it.
@jetblue i wish you all the best of luck :-) i am enjoying the luxurious free!! amount of leg space rn. thanks
@jetblue i do not want jetblue +tv. i want jetblue +wifi :(((
@jetblue great to see the redsox plane and your reminder you ❤️ny side by side at jfk #catsanddogslivingtogether http://t.co/kfuyyokufv
@jetblue would love to go to hawaii to visit pearl harbor.
@jetblue what is the deal with flt 460 today? departure keeps changing. when is it going why is it so late flight?
@jetblue laugh out loud at your estimated departure time. plane has not even started boarding yet. you cannot even get your delays right.
@jetblue @martysg you *know* how i love you jb but honestly when you have complex feedback those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening.
@jetblue said they have not started looking for it gave me a $25-$100 limit. in new york city at the waldorf astoria and cannot find $100 outfit. 😒
@jetblue how can i best track deals and special flight offers? i am liking your international options...
@jetblue yeah i am aware of that. hence my original message to you.
@jetblue 653. just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. airline is a disaster.
@jetblue no i asked. either way it does not make the flight less delayed.
@jetblue 2324 from orlando to dca ! and my awesome flight attendant is robert!
@jetblue yes i filed yesterday around noon. i have a claim number but they have not contacted me yet.
@jetblue shocker my flight delayed an hour. thanks for reminding me why i switched to delta.
@jetblue as courtesy to mosaic members or anyone a request for water should be attended promptly. daniel in flight 1557 should know better
@jetblue are you having any issues with online check-in? my colleague and i are getting webpage not available after submitting online form
@jetblue no one yet but some fl 8162
@jetblue are going to let fl382 into a gate in bos any time soon? we're just sittin' here on the tarmac waiting.
@jetblue thanks jb. actually as a birder i love them too. they just need to be outside. it should not be too hard to trap and move them.
@jetblue not an issue but i think training &amp; information would help. great people but service needs to switch from individual to group better
@jetblue rats that's a bummer!
@jetblue is so sloooooow today
happy for sfo but hopefully you'll add pdx soon “@jetblue we added two new destinations (fll and sfo) from las vegas in the last year!”
@jetblue flight from jfk-sfo was pure awesomeness. mint class and timothy our attendant was the best! other airlines take notes!
@jetblue terrible landing on 915
@jetblue flight was two days ago. flight 1918 from pos.
@jetblue wall separating in row 1. #safetyconcerns http://t.co/ztrdwv0n4l
@jetblue last sleep in cali... back to jfk tomorrow night. looking forward to an another amazing flight with you all :)
@jetblue woo! update! flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs! power of positive thinking people.
@jetblue appreciate the response but already spoke to a mco and their response was there is nothing we can do I do not know if that's what you mean
@jetblue with the free wifi #impressive #flyfi http://t.co/t1rypzebc8
@jetblue did not find out my flight for ny scheduled to leave at 9:30pm is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until after checking in. huge fail.
@jetblue vegas desk said jfk connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at jfk says weather was problem. #epicfail
@jetblue other jfk to boston flights went off with some delay but not this. #epicfail
@jetblue i understand delays. we are all looking at a tv monitor at your gate and it says current conditions are snow hence delay.
@jetblue mint seats are awesome! :-) @emaleesugano best business class in the us!!!
@jetblue - what the fuck stuck at jfk for 2+ hours in a delay to boston cuz you say snow. no snow on weather map!!! wtf!!!
@jetblue thank you for getting me home. and despite all odds i have reunited with my delinquent southwest luggage. now homeward
@jetblue 2 words: staff training. what a joke-
@jetblue is a joke. missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. last flight of the day and they do not hold it. 5 minutes.
@jetblue sorry should have specified i meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal
@jetblue any idea what's going on at terminal five at jfk? seems to be zero traffic movement
@jetblue very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. i nearly had to beg get just for a courtesy report
@jetblue okay thanks. safety first.
@jetblue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from san juan. monsoon there today?
@jetblue that's ok! it just sure seemed like it when jetblue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. haha
@jetblue over 2 hour delay going from new york city to denver! come on man!
@jetblue @amybruni @directtv no oscars on direct tv on this flight. we were so looking forward to it. we were devastated. :-/
@jetblue - fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges. 40 minute delay second gate...still waiting! #jetblues http://t.co/ncb2oncs9i
kudos well deserved! just wish the rest of my @jetblue experience today measured up to their example!
@jetblue ha ha! can i get a wake up call at boarding time please? large coffee extralight extra sweet please!
@jetblue did not work. fly-fi plus could not access abc app. so i spent $19 and still missed oscars. #disappointed
@jetblue 👍. i think i will come take a nap at the terminal. ;)
@jetblue safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
@jetblue @zakkohane pretty sure he is saying ricoh had great service down at bos ;) #happytohelp
@jetblue #611 from jfk to las still delayed?
@jetblue the lack of tv made it rough that's literally why i picked y'all over the competitors.
@jetblue but not reddit? i work for the site and this is ridiculous.
@jetblue thank you! i am your new big fan :)
@jetblue i do! the best airline wifi ever. thank you!
@jetblue you just tight that you're #59 on the world's best airlines list &amp; @virginatlantic is ranked higher! @virginatlantic here i come!
@jetblue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi😭 why dont you guys go to maimi???
@jetblue such a bummer. but i understand it is a business deal. thanks for answering me! much less sad now.
@jetblue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! then just carry on the extra weight. for someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
@jetblue pilot: do not worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane. thanks guy
@jetblue can you take @cosmopolitan off your blacklist... trying to work :(
@jetblue goodwill now at $125.00. $27000 x ? = fine still want your new Chief Executive Officer to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136
@jetblue thank you! hopefully it is soon! we are supposed to leave at 11:23
@jetblue thank you!
@jetblue awesome
@jetblue okay so anything using contactless emv should work just your internal testing and training is currently apple pay specific?
@jetblue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. we should get better than this
@jetblue had a potentially stressful situation in reflight booking problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
@jetblue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane just as a carry on. where is the sense? what do you say to fat people?
@jetblue i thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs i am carrying it on 😒
@jetblue are you all going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? you went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! outrageous
@jetblue if only the show was on the flight. no abc. oh well. i will live. #nexttime #andthewinneris...
@jetblue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
@jetblue im still waiting??? no answer!!
@jetblue ok. thanks for your help.
@jetblue love you guys😍😍😍 http://t.co/3x9nruovts
@jetblue the amount of money i spent on hotels for a week bc of flight cancelled flightlation another flight does not make up for the money lost.
@jetblue being told jfk had a 5 hour delay this am which is reason for my delay now. it cannot be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
@jetblue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
keep waiting time does not cost anything for @jetblue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/ji2pg4gom9
@jetblue you're still the best
@jetblue @abcnetwork please give jetblue all the permissions in the world! i am missing the oscars right now and it is awful #whyabcwhy
@jetblue thanks. so the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather relate flightd problems?
@jetblue @shannonwoodward i will be checking often. most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds geeks and badly dressed.
@jetblue i am less concerned about the delay than i am about not being notified until i looked at the board that my flight was delayed
@jetblue thanks! i made it 😃
@jetblue after boarding flight 0510 the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hours regulation and turned the plane around. incredible!
@jetblue thanks for the quick response! fingers crossed the plane gets here then
@jetblue @julesdameron considering? #accessibility is an absolute must! #equality
@jetblue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! no abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
@jetblue thank you. fingers crossed.
.@jetblue ooookay @abc that's silly of you. guess we're watching the oscars purely on twitter reactions tonight. #oscars
@jetblue i have heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept only apple pay. i thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not emv compliant
@jetblue you're taking me to new orleans in two weeks so i will picture that while i shiver #forevercold
@jetblue we're flight 1472 ffl to lga. scheduled departure 8:15p.
@jetblue second time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. last time i was not allowed to fly stndby now a 2 hour delay w/out notification
@jetblue oh right! me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in sdq http://t.co/7gb0hgw51t
@jetblue. a bunch of flights are delayed from ffl to northeast destinations. no announcements at the gate. what's going on?
@jetblue i am dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in santo domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no information given
@jetblue id appreciate that. would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that i be allowed to announce over intercom?
@shannonwoodward if you want we can keep you updated on who's wearing who &amp; who's with who &amp; who wins what. we're nice like that. ;)
@jetblue i did. they have no idea where it is.
@jetblue thanks but still annoying. especially if i miss my flight. 😉 can i tweet at the tsa??
@jetblue hey jetblue. still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8 surfboard between jfk and bqn airports.
@jetblue your gif game is strong.
@jetblue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ml1jacpmch
@jetblue flight 98 den to jfk already 2hrs delayed. any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@jetblue why close prechk at 8pm on a sunday at jfk? #annoying
@jetblue your crew did not say it was about safety. if they say that i was glad to stay ... check the information you give to the costumers
@jetblue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in south florida bc of your disorganization. #getittogether
@jetblue i am going to write a post on @medium about the experience. your customer service has tanked. #jetblue
@jetblue still no response from ceo. i guess he is at the oscars. i bet his flight was on time. #justwrong
@jetblue okay. names of sj crew are alamo tatiana. keep telling me to hold then leave desk. ali told me he could not help bc going on break
@jetblue aha ok. thanks! was worried there might not be a seat at all :) will do it at the airport tomorrow then!
@jetblue that is a stock response. delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 people to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
@jetblue ricoh smith at bos provided oust and service
@jetblue 4 hr delay on flight to jfk via tampa &amp; worst customer service in san juan airport. this after app not working all day.
@jetblue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / logan airport and i will be able to go home!
@jetblue what happens when i have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for even more space upgrades?
@jetblue thanks for the response. just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. seems like no one at jetblue is concerned.
@jetblue tx for the info. just do not understand why you could not accurately estimate departure time earlier. weather in ny is fine now.
@jetblue hey me and my family have questions on a trip to disney world that we are doing in april . please follow me so i could direct message you guys
“@jetblue: @finleybklyncfs so glad to hear. thanks for sharing the video.” me and jetblue are #bff 🙏
@jetblue no m'good. just get me home
@jetblue thanks for the response. we are hopeful.
@jetblue update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
@jetblue okay tx. will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate
@jetblue thank you for not even coming with a solution. great service i might say...as a trueblue member i am totally dissatisfied...thanks
@jetblue all day
@jetblue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of pbi to make up for 2.5 hr delay? treat us right.
@jetblue why is flight 1106 delayed out to ny? same problem?
@jetblue is that a guarantee? we'll see about that tomorrow morning when i have to fight for a seat.
@jetblue thanks for the update. 'preciate it. hope it gets here. been delayed 2 days getting back
@jetblue yes. they are working on it. hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
@jetblue well...my paid tickets have no assigned seats at all. so essentially i won't be on this flight unless i pay more.
@jetblue if seats are not guaranteed why do we pay for them? when i called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
@jetblue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. excellent customer service and focus
@jetblue yes please get me the seats we paid for.
@jetblue flight 136 departs 2:14 am finally!!! arrived jfk with no psgrs at 5:39 pm. that's a long flight. aka bus http://t.co/kfkjf1ztgi
@jetblue thanks for help. cannot wait to travel with! and get out of the snow.
@jetblue help - i left my nikon camera under the seat in front of me. what do i do?
@jetblue i hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper.
@jetblue the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can you all help.
for your information @jetblue: the last email response - we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you -but hope 2 wlcm you back onbrd n the future... nice touch. laugh out loud
@jetblue i think i have it selected already ☺️
@jetblue last flight was cancelled flightled then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb now sitting here waiting for maintenance. unreal.
@jetblue thanks for answering my questions!
@jetblue that was not delayed or cabcelled
@jetblue i have to say that jetblue has officially lost a customer. what a waste of all the points i have too! i am yet to be in a flight..
@jetblue i will keep on tweeting until your Chief Executive Officer answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. just wrong!!
@jetblue i think it is safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #jetblue flying we are officially done. #byebyejetblue
@jetblue i have someone driving me it is best to get a wheelchair once i get inside?
@jetblue finally! finally!
@jetblue token $75.00 goodwill voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from phoenix today. 3 hour mark. how about a $27000 per passenger
@jetblue anything serious i should worry about?
@jetblue cool! are there stairs at jfk? i can walk short distances but not stairs.
@jetblue think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2larive0...
@jetblue why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you?? #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8sb0rbicx
@jetblue seriously what is your solution? who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vpdrplxj5a
@jetblue your scheduling skills failed. the delay went from four hours to nearly six. do not tell me you were snowbound in pbi.
@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. please dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
@jetblue sadly no! i have the app but it also is experiencing difficulties. the flight information boards are keeping me updated.
@jetblue this is absurd. should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/laiggef9kj
@jetblue i have a disabled seat in row 6 do i get to board earlier?
@jetblue thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel when bag missed connection. #sfo #customerservicenot
@jetblue flight 2008
@jetblue pittsburgh
@jetblue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@jetblue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? so why having it as one of the services if not applied?
@jetblue if you want to be helpful find us a seat. do not quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail
@jetblue do you really think it is okay to sit kids away from parents?! srsly?! especially after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6syw3mdvu
@jetblue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. your terms response is insulting. #jetblue
@jetblue flight 1025 jfk to tpa 8:05am on saturday! one way ticket!
@jetblue what's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from lga to tpa? i know the plane is in the air.
@jetblue if you cannot guarantee parents will sit with their children do not sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/hdoxim6nz2
@jetblue once you go blue you do not go back
@jetblue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
@jetblue kids fly. do not hire people who do not care about them. this guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfguzw
@jetblue i should not be made to feel like a criminal because i want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtcao1j2u
@jetblue usually i have such a great experience with you guys? very very unhappy with you right now.
@jetblue why would you hire a guy who does not care about the safety of children? not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lkfh9hyhw8
@jetblue what's up? three delays so far resulting in over three hours of unnecessary extra waiting.
@jetblue for the record that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question. jetblue rocks!
@jetblue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. but this guy is willing to do it. #jetblue http://t.co/mzzfgqfhu2
@jetblue from san diego with a 4 hour delay to jfk!even you have a amex jetblue even having over 50.000 travel miles you're still nothing
@jetblue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. but this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6nzyspk
@jetblue third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. this will be my last trip with you.
@jetblue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at jfk because of inbound flight from syracuse really? #ishouldhavedriven
@jetblue a 5 year old cannot sit alone on a flight. this is absurd. and this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2hxsdp0ha4
@jetblue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49flbgzzkd
@jetblue of my tray table is broken what do i do?
@jetblue domestic. to be clear -- i do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding? thanks!
@jetblue thanks for not! sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. unbelievable!
@jetblue the fact that #chrishasmadeusblush is not trending is how you know i am loyal ;)
@jetblue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments? really? &amp; as mosaic i still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a sunday?
@jetblue no i have not done that yet. is that something i can do online? thx!
@jetblue woof i am on the red carpet http://t.co/iidrblnoox
@jetblue @amybruni no wifi on this flight so we cannot tweet you our oscar party pics at 37000ft. #bluecarpet :-( sea✈️bos
@jetblue thank you for the reply. would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. jetblue used to be my go-to
@jetblue what confirmation number?
@jetblue you also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done. wtf?
@jetblue you guys really suck! i just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account. they are still not there! 1/2
@jetblue by the way robin hayes is speaking at next month's @uschamber aviation summit. he ought to give a shout out to his twitter team. you rock
@jetblue follow for direct message please
@jetblue oh. and thank you for responding
@jetblue where is it coming from? i thought tampa?
@jetblue good perspective. if only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before i arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
@jetblue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 bdl to dca? cannot seem to get an answer
@jetblue thanks. we are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. i hope we make it out. fingers crossed
@jetblue flight from bos - rsw tomorrow all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together but no option when checking in.
@jetblue is your partnership with hawaiian live? earn hawaiian miles flying jetblue ? if so how do i add @hawaiianair to my jb flight booking problems ?
@jetblue you left 175 people on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to jfk because of ....
@jetblue at what point in delays can i take a different flight to my destination?
@jetblue thank you guys! you are the best! 🙌✈️
@jetblue you just do not get it. it is not about the money it is about people!!!! how about a public apology from the president of jet blue.
@jetblue why when you book a flight now does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? is not that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!
@jetblue does not fit in 140
@jetblue love it as always!
@jetblue you never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 goodwill credit will make everything hunky-dory. you blew it.
@jetblue every time i look at the flight status 30 more minutes is added to the delay. how about some points for trouble??
as soon as i can sending my son home with you saturday. @jetblue
@jetblue hey awesome peeps what's up with flight 1159 from boston? delayed 3hrs?

@jetblue 118 to boston still sitting
@jetblue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
@jetblue hope so! looks nice and warm in san juan 🌴
@jetblue thanks for replying-i feel a little better we'll see how it goes ☺️✈️
@jetblue i usually do-but i did not make the flight booking problems this time-that'll teach me! yea i have that going for me at least haha
@jetblue i waited 3 hours for my bags and my flight was only 2 hours
@jetblue should i bother contacting them? i already checked into my flight 😕
@jetblue early last month via expedia-there's an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name
@jetblue backlog is an hour at most this is over two! unacceptable!!
@jetblue your agent told us tsa did not have a crew to get bags!
@jetblue you guys rock!
@jetblue my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ☺👍👍
@jetblue awesome! #bestairlineever
@jetblue no baggage crew update! your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
@jetblue the whole plane. flight 561 from lga to pbi http://t.co/4ktk2hsmgy
@jetblue is blaming @tsa for flight 584 luggage debacle! #luggagegate
@jetblue w/ edits: dear @msbgu your mbas need better benefits. they should work for us. how can we meet them?
@jetblue of course i am!!✈️
@jetblue you failed. that's the answer. please do not justify otherwise.
@jetblue come on! already delayed 2+ hours on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from boston now you reassign him?! endless trip.
@jetblue when i got your alert i immediately started looking to rebook. but we only had 11 minutes from reflight booking problems to catch a flight to srq.
@jetblue i only fly jet blue
@jetblue perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu ;)
@jetblue start including pto in your getaway packages and i am all in
@jetblue thanks. i will use the extra time to do some more shopping! did somebody say duty free?
@jetblue's flight flight booking problems experience is pretty great!
@jetblue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
@jetblue thanks for making my trip home #mintyfresh next #brandmance flight i will take more selfies! #love #travel #business
@jetblue i should not have to find them they should tell us. i have flown jet blue since your first month. the experience is not what it was.
@jetblue if my flight was delayed can i show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do i have to go on time?
@jetblue i am over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
@jetblue if that was the case why did your alert arrive so late flight? four-hour delay? do not buy it.
@jetblue our flight out no tv. now our flight back not seated together. b6 620. maybe our fault still no fun.
@jetblue i do not believe so. that's not what the team has told us.
@jetblue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
@jetblue #1691 out of jfk. no one has information &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky
@jetblue i have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. can i get on list at ctg
@jetblue flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. most of us checked in 12 hours ago. people are missing connections. please help!
@jetblue any way to get 2 people on standby list for flight 1970 fll to bos. trying to find way home.
@jetblue something to think about when you are dealing with people!!!!! just wrong. no excuses. figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
@jetblue i understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier versus sitting for 2 hours at mco
@jetblue what gives? delayed over 2 hours at mco to jfk. every time!
“@jetblue: @2littlebirds well captured brittany! we love the clouds! :) enjoy the ride!” thank you!
@jetblue my wife was with our dog. they would not even let her out off the plane. my daughter was at newburgh lives close by. so wrong
@jetblue according to your ground staff it has not even been taken off the plane yet!
.@jetblue thanks for making an effort. credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
@jetblue at what time? all these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. just wrong
@jetblue flight delayed at jfk 2 hours then 3 hours then 8.5 hours? now it is back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?
@jetblue thanks! have a good sunday.
@jetblue flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?
@jetblue 5hrs on tarmac yest b4 cancelled flight @12am.today 3+ hr delay. why not send txt/email re: jfk closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
@jetblue flying out of buffer 2 bos missing captain... really? delayed til 2:00... not happy...
@jetblue it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.
his name is enzo 😊 retweet @jetblue : @setorii well hello there pooch! what's your name? #dog http://t.co/dlh9138hbg
@jetblue i know but i wanted to pass it along. not good for the t5 experience especially for someone who flies 2-3 times a month.
@jetblue flight 136 departed phoenix at 1:30 am
@jetblue so what about the plane stuck in newburgh won't start. it that weather relate flightd as well. these passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
@jetblue thanks. home to msy. tsa precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. one grabbed and pushed children.
@jetblue promo watch phone $33 at amazon check http://t.co/lenaowfyvu
@jetblue your hold music sucks.
@jetblue customer of the year? http://t.co/epqqonho2h
@jetblue jfk t5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too.
@jetblue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
@jetblue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed that would have helped.
@jetblue get me home! flight 2016 from buffer to bos is missing a captain!? really!?
@jetblue nope. this 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! i cannot believe i paid money for this.
@jetblue thank you. we are finally at the gate.
@jetblue flight to orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... so they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. that works
@jetblue @cookjaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. way to go. #hopeless
@jetblue @amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
@jetblue do not i always?
@jetblue landing! as usual great flight wiyh a great crew. hello sunny west palm beach ! #jetbluerocks
@jetblue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane there are are newborns on board
@jetblue waiting at hpn on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate please get us off this plane!
@jetblue too late flight. several passengers are inebriated. you're in league with big alcohol. shame on you.
@jetblue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... currently waiting on the runway for another hour to deplane
@jetblue letting me down in san fran. no media rate? what's the deal? looks like this is the last time i fly anywhere with you.
@jetblue they were amazing and thank you!
@jetblue and have empty help desks
@jetblue there was a closure? people here need to inform passengers not send them gate to gate w no information on boards re: updated departures
@jetblue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. no problem there
@jetblue when will the system be up and running?
@jetblue thanks for the third gate change http://t.co/ufbdr5axeo

@jetblue 795 to austin
@jetblue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice you guys rock!
@jetblue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? seems organizational error not weather.
@jetblue where is the award winning service?
@jetblue really not acceptable. just informed plane won't start. chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
@jetblue how much longer to jfk open's i am a diabetic and i need sugar plane do not have nothing
@jetblue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. anyone have a clue? it is 36 and sunny at jfk
@jetblue you guys have 2b kidding. no help anywhere. 5 hour delays? still no answers. bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/dpx3yogtej
@jetblue they are now being sent off the plane? does anyone at jetblue have a clue?
@jetblue unfortunately i was so startled and rushed i did not get the name but will provide a description in my expanded email. thank you
@jetblue your customer service agent bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
@jetblue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
@jetblue bos. everything current now. thanks for the follow up
@jetblue it is sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. what's the real reason?
@jetblue thanks for the info. already doing it now before we board! looking forward to the future upgrades! #jetblue http://t.co/5db9esbnzg
@jetblue things happen it is okay just wish i was on the beach and not in the airport
@jetblue it is been 3 hours why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at jfk? this is absolutely ridiculous.
@jetblue any idea when the flight will actually take off?
@jetblue i love #jetblue ! #flyfi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic #a320 flights?! thanks! http://t.co/obqiro1buj
@jetblue still sitting in plane in newburg. this is getting #ridiculous. no way to treat #loyal customers.
@jetblue touchdown jfk! well done pilots of jetblue flight 226! #jetbluerocks
@jetblue what's the delay if the system is not down?
@jetblue not blaming jet blue. this was not weather. cannot have planes in the air and runways a mess. that's a disaster waiting to happen.
@jetblue do not think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. now 12
@jetblue that is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where i can go buy water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
@jetblue and ask she load the bag for my flight
@jetblue after applying my new tag she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..i had to walk back 50 yards
@jetblue get flight 16 into the air
@jetblue that's not weather relate flightd. you are just being nice and blaming the weather. airport just was not prepared. investigation time.
@jetblue if i had my tux it'd be a date! #umosaicmecrazy http://t.co/hap4gbostu
@jetblue thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
@jetblue then this agent demanded i remove my old luggage tag every other airport the jb agent politely handles it
@jetblue i am also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue alot....
@jetblue it is not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. just give us an honest estimate
@jetblue she waved someone behind me to step forward although i explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
@jetblue #489. flight #589 is departing before we even board
@jetblue i knew there was a reason you were my favorite airline. just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. great job
@jetblue here is part: was at bag drop inserted my jetblue cc did not print pass. agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass
@jetblue it is only because i am wearing #truebluecolors!
@jetblue flight16?
@jetblue that's not what i heard. weather was fine this morning. flight 136 was circling for some time.someone forgot to clean the runway.
@jetblue when it is 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as on time #updateyourwebsite #489
@jetblue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/wmx12f33zc
@jetblue how can your entire system go down? no it? really?
@jetblue appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in boston #communicationfail #dobetterjetblue
@jetblue seriously? system down? no it?
@jetblue yup we know not your fault just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great!
@jetblue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers i will document and send details off to boston

@jetblue got it. thanks the quick reply.
@jetblue is not this something you should do?! why should i tell your crew how to do their job?
@jetblue your app needs updating. says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/btvpxtzju0
@jetblue do bags still fly free or have you started charging? thanks!
@jetblue had a great experience working with glenn coles at buffalo-niagara airport!! top notch employee
@jetblue well the last update was in the right direction at least! i will keep my fingers crossed.
@jetblue charleston - from your app guys as of a few minutes ago!!! http://t.co/seulpvfn95
@jetblue thanks social media person!
@jetblue are there airport-wide delays at bos or did we just get unlucky with 152?
@jetblue just left #laguardia now...#sunshine in a little over 2 hours
@jetblue i hear you and safety is #1! i think we can get to jfk though now so let us help the pilots passengers &amp; crew get there safely!
@jetblue is jfk still closed? tryna get out of ft lauderdale on flight 502 just want to get home to nyc!

@jetblue flt 136 from phx. delayed 2 hours circle 1 hr divert to upstate ny just sitting for 1 hr no communication #horrible
@jetblue they miraculously fixed the plane #kudos to shoe ever it was
@jetblue that's cause we're trueblue! it is your #love that keeps liftin' me #higherandhigher https://t.co/xgfs6tjtmo http://t.co/ixm3t5mizc
@jetblue all your online resources say we're on time but clearly we are not. this is not very information age of you...
@jetblue ..... no crew at our gate.
@jetblue 😭😭😭😭 you all are really better then american airlines though.
@jetblue why do not you tell them to update the boards?!
what can i say other than when it comes to my #brandloveaffair w/ @jetblue your my #soulandinspiration https://t.co/igkogywksr #umosaicmecrazy
@jetblue issue is jfk. pilot explained once jfk reopens we can get scheduled back there but why cannot we divert to lga? closer than acy!
@jetblue you want me to talk to the wall?
@jetblue great service from pbi to hpn! thanks.
@jetblue its poor flight management. there is no reason why a scheduled 8:00 pm flight to takr off at 11:00pm .
@jetblue hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive &amp; that will be our flight to depart.
@jetblue done thank you!

@jetblue @fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won't put you standby? #stranded
@jetblue yes they said the runway is not ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight.
@jetblue i travel for business twice a week and after the @americanair fiasco i will be flying blue more often. thanks.
@jetblue we are on flight 751 and were returning to the gate can you provide any information?
@jetblue won't see my money again after their poor service should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue???
@jetblue suck and their customer services are the worst whats the point of having a loyalty scheme that they do not honor #badairline
@jetblue i see my flight from boston to pitts is okay from this afternoon. did you have any delays for the morning flight?
@jetblue fll to mde great flight great customer service thanks! 2 mths waiting @americanair to speak to a human at customer service

@jetblue they just came out. thanks for the follow-up. that's why you're the best!

@jetblue yep still waiting for bags at #jfk. what's the holdup? looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..??
@jetblue thanks for getting us to new york city -jfk really safely. :-) but srsly? how long does it take to get our checked bags? #eternity #5ammisery
@jetblue should i expect delays at dca for 7am departure? going to orlando on flight 723
@jetblue full the six of us had to leave flight. and now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school.
@jetblue no. not boarding order. someone boarded with. service animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was
@jetblue it is ridiculous that i just got home and i was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc i am hella tired
@jetblue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
@jetblue thanks for the response - when is the next flight after the 9:48 flight?
@jetblue highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 😒
@jetblue great flight on a brand new jet. great seating. beautiful plane. big fan of this airline.
@jetblue a voucher.. i cannot believe i took this risk. not only was the plane terribly filthy and i had 15 screaming babies in my face..
@jetblue @southwestair @virginamerica @americanairbr download jeokoo the american app for air travelers
@jetblue thank you! i know the weather in #boston is not great. everyone's tired
@jetblue i have spoken 2/emailed jb team and explained situation. didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. i guess i just expected more.
@jetblue alright i hope. my jetblue app is showing a change in my seats and online shows an a320. do not want any surprises
@jetblue i know you guys are super busy but is flight 1222 an a320 or e190?
@jetblue follow me pls?
@jetblue shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at delhi airport friday boarding to dubai. disgusting
@jetblue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight i watched equalizer (movie) three times because my remote was stuck
@jetblue @dgruber1700 oh wow and i am complaining about two hour on the run way shucks jetblue not good your service was better than this
@jetblue i am curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate
@jetblue thank you thank you! i finally set up the jetblue app! yay!

@jetblue i have more flights that i would love to redeem for some points but they're a little over a year old. is there a historical limit?
@jetblue has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem
@jetblue what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? any chance of it being a false alarm?

@jetblue inconvenience is an understatement. more like torture. clearly going down the wrong path jetblue.
@jetblue do not just cling on to the safety card. it safety was really an issue then flight would have landed immediately. .
@jetblue no. did not catch his name. i am sure jason will know.
@jetblue i waited in line all that time to be told by a crewmember that there's no update until 9:30 #3hrdelay #disappointed
@jetblue phone agents cannot see same flights i see online??? cannot change tickets even when i am paying. very frustrating #jetblue
@jetblue why was flight 669 forced to return to ny when there was a malfunction? why not land in the countless air strips surrounding chi?

@jetblue i appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in buffer #currentlysittingontarmac
@jetblue after 40 mins they tell us they cannot check temperature for at least 2 more hours. so it is back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail

@jetblue hi. i am trying to find a flight to the middle east.
@jetblue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
@jetblue yep. 1 hour at logan. gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. they just arrived. passengers request butt massages.
@jetblue i love your flights! but theres always some delay unfortunately
@jetblue yes thankfully! catering just got here and now they are loading but very frustrated. i was supposed to be there by 10-10:30
@jetblue my butt hurts.
@jetblue that's what they told me half an hour ago
@jetblue i have been hanging here for almost an hour
@jetblue took forever for catering to get to my flight now are very delayed. so ticked off right now.
@jetblue it is absurd that i have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is late flight. you dont have others?
@jetblue safety first !! #lovejetblue
@jetblue delayed flight bummer
@jetblue here in austin i saw the water bottles &amp; snacks @ the desk for your waiting passengers! im so flight booking problems my next flight with you!

@jetblue although it was not totally the answer i was looking for i appreciate the prompt response.
@jetblue guess i will wait another 24 hours in hopes rate goes down &amp; is more reasonable. fingers crossed. cutting it close to my travel dates.
@jetblue do you do any discounts for volunteer firefighters?
@jetblue well i fly into huntsville al. but i would take either nashville or birmingham too!
@jetblue if your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like i cannot fly jetblue this time around cannot afford that price
@jetblue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. did not feel safe.
@jetblue oh yes! i hope you expand to other airports soon so i can fly you to see my family each year!!!!
@jetblue been a member since 2007. looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. could not book right away due to all the snow; i am in bos.
@jetblue thanks jb!! this is why i 💙 you!
@jetblue but thank you! love an anxious flyer.
@jetblue same exact flight too. love jetblue. really want to fly with ya'll. but that's a little pricey for basic (not mint). bos to sfo.
@jetblue i do not want to seem crazy! have already asked twice!
@jetblue flight i want to book was $320 one day; went to purchase next day &amp; price doubled to $737. inquiring on chance it may go down?
@jetblue sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions still no response. need answers before (hopefully) flight booking problems flight...
@jetblue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. i am looking for something a little more specific.
@jetblue if i am about to get on a plane i think i deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed.
@jetblue can you give me an update on flight 1684 mco-&gt;jfk? they're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...

@jetblue not to get into semantics here but by means within the extent or period of; during and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary
@jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home
@jetblue first flight of the morning flying with a toddler. will the plane be heated to a comfortable temp before boarding starts. #itscold

@jetblue @tsa jetblue never disappoints !

@jetblue quick question to pay for a second bag do i have to do it online or can i do it at the airport?
@jetblue not cool to announce a flight delay when everyone is checking in. a 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering no help.
@jetblue hi. how do i claim points on a 1800-flowers order after i purchased? i totally forgot to put in the promo code.
@jetblue what's the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should've taken place 30 minutes ago.
@jetblue yes slc on 4/19

@jetblue: ahoy from a loyal #allyoucanjetpass holder! when do you anticipate direct us flights to #havana #cuba? (#jetblue #vacation)
@jetblue that is my point! they are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they cancelled flightled.
@jetblue excited for my first flight w/ you today! it is delayed though- can you give me the 411? flight number 989 from boston to dc
@jetblue what is the mosiac 800 #?
@jetblue i can probably find some of them. are the ticket #s on there?

@jetblue my bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. help!

@jetblue seems a few of my friends speak highly as well. now we just need to find a decent priced way to go from yvr to sea and overnight.
@jetblue does @aircanada not take fraud as seriously?
@jetblue i want to add my flight to mexico was on air canada. same exact situation but with none of the problems i have had with jet blue.
@jetblue you mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department does not have email or telephones. right?
@jetblue capital one and i explained the false fraud alert. why did the jet blue representative issue me a new tkt if it was not resolved?
@jetblue thanks
@jetblue then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.
@jetblue @nhlbruins repping the bruins in cleveland at rock n roll hof &amp; the christmas story house #jetbluebruins http://t.co/jknwugj778
@jetblue no it did not all work out. i called jet blue from mexico to address the fraud alert with capital one on the line. rebooked.
@jetblue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
@jetblue i called jet blue to get an explanation and make sure it would not happen in the future. i was told to write the fraud dept.
@jetblue we made it safe and sound. thank you for the safe travels.
@jetblue when i arrived at the airport i was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert.
@jetblue my card company and i explained the issue over the phone when i was in mexico. i purchased a new ticket over the phone.
@jetblue but jet blue had cancelled flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it.
@jetblue my credit card company accidentally marked my jet blue tickets as fraud then corrected their mistake and reposted the money.
@jetblue has screwed me over for the last time. @southwestair glad to give you my business. #jetscrew #awfulcustomerservice
@jetblue alternatives? you have absolutely no respect for loyal customers. 8 years. no more. i am done.
@jetblue any thoughts on waiver of change fees for travel out of boston this weekend?

@jetblue flight attendant wendi on flt 127 on 2/17 newark to orlando. 👍👍
@jetblue does not help if i have to fly on specific days
@jetblue it is noting about me i m perfectly fine it is the attitude and dealings with flyers. stubborn. demanding. unwilling to accommodate.
@jetblue there's just so many choices for y'all south of the border and i know not every airline is equal - lowest price != best value. ;)
@jetblue just looking to arrange for a nice flight from sea to la-ish and comparing the cost to something more direct from yvr.

@jetblue loves cancelled flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited
@jetblue tickets were confirmed and sent out. find out today that they cancelled flightled our tickets months ago and never sent an email #jetblue
@jetblue would have been good to know months ago that you cancelled flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #neveragain
@jetblue rather than trying to resolve customer issues only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #justifythissupport
@jetblue i am on flight and no booze being served 30 minute in... what gives? #lostrevenue #angryandsober #bachelorpartymishap
@jetblue i have used you guys for 10 years but after this experience i will never ever use you again.
@jetblue managers telling us to write a letter because we're upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting cancelled flightled without any notice
@jetblue you guys are lucky i love you
@jetblue maybe stop telling people the wrong information on your customer service calls.
@jetblue customer service was so bad updating my points once i use my next points i won't be flying you. point system is almost a sham.
@jetblue ruining vacations left and right. who would have thought an airline can cancelled flight tickets without telling the buyer
@jetblue better find a way to get me to puerto rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid
@jetblue i spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. i want my confirmed flight to be taken care of

@jetblue the magic eight ball has never steered me wrong :)
@jetblue you wanna help out? how about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose.
@jetblue but you guys should know that musicians are very sensitive about the safety of their instruments when flying. for good reason.
@jetblue ask @j_beatz247 but i teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how not to treat passengers.
@jetblue loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w/ customers. just ask nola musician @j_beatz247 about that. #shameful
@jetblue i am game if you're buying!! ;)
@jetblue will do. thanks!

@jetblue not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable..
@jetblue we even went to the airport and were on the phone for hours and no help at all. everyone said different things.
@jetblue people kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight.
@jetblue i understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out late flightr that night but only one of us got to take it

@jetblue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. we were completely blindsided!

@jetblue i have had no shampoo no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat
@jetblue my sil bought tix for us to nyc. we were told at the gate that her cc was declined. supervisor accused us of illegal activity.

@jetblue flight was cancelled flighted. do i need to file a claim for the $50 credit i am entitled to per year bill of rights or will it just be issued?

@jetblue thank you for your excellent customer service - resolved issue quickly.
@jetblue yes well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. no better than thieves.
@jetblue that's not an option for us. so how can we help each other fix this? i would've made the change earlier if given accurate info.
@jetblue well now saying our flight is going to be cancelled flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2
@jetblue tell your employees that!

@usairways we were moved to a delta direct. thank you for the accommodations!
@usairways agree! richard p. literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude inappropriate comments to us and our family. awful!

@usairways how do i get a receipt for a change fee when i originally booked with miles?
@usairways: you did not bother following up we booked with @delta. @delta understands cust srv: provided lunch 4 delays &amp; upgraded seats!

@usairways has the worst customer service. cannot even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me
@usairways @beamske but maybe i can be on hold for 30 minutes again. that would be just as amazing.
@usairways @beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
@usairways is your clt departures delayed? hoping i can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
@usairways i am glad @beamske retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets i sent. you all are fucking amazing
@usairways so frustrating because i still have not gotten them back. why my bag was sent to ny is a mystery! shame on me this time!
@usairways i will never travel us airways again. flew in from la to dc last night and for the second time on this airline my bags did not arrive

@usairways been on hold for 2 hours for something which i could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.your site ux is awe full
@usairways then drop your fee! $150 ($300rt!!!!) makes no sense; most eu airlines charge $0. @aircanada charges a reasonable $50.
@usairways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
@usairways another fiasco at national. forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from rdu

@usairways still ignoring my question. #usairways consistently providing poor customer service.
@usairways they have all of this at hotels. still do not have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/jieycat1ek

@usairways should give me free baggage for this mess
@usairways gate traffic #dca my flight arrived 20 earlyconnecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. several of us stuck. hold that plane.
@usairways i really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
@usairways i know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
@usairways seriously??? did you not see that i have spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
@usairways waiting on my flight right now thanks!!

@usairways youre batting .1000. every flight ive taken is delayed. worst airline. ever.
@usairways knows customer service!! thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! thank you sarita!!!
@usairways why are not you updating flight status/delays?
@usairways they're also saying the clt flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
@usairways nope they just announced we're headed back to the gate.
@usairways pretty sure we did not actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4unu
@usairways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day i have wasted. i have got a job &amp; family this is crazy
@usairways 5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate
@usairways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
@usairways what's wrong with the plane? flt 581

@usairways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. she said because i told you to! expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!
@usairways since january 22 have been on 10 flights. why the disrespect in clt flt #2063 at 2:50pm on 18feb to dca? just asked herba question
@usairways nah it is for my flight next week.. inside my chairman 7-day window but you still have not released the last open first seat to me
@usairways flight 1946 out of clt this morning. it is snowing here. should i head out to the airport?
@usairways i have been on hold for 41min. just trying to change my reservation.
@usairways i am a uk citizen. is there a uk number i could try?
@usairways i just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. entire experience #epicfail
@usairways changing my flights with no explanations and still do not have a confirmation. so disappointed in the service
@usairways nope not yet...
@usairways i will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. my luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
@usairways my flight was cancelled flighted saturday. why was my luggage not at the airport? today i am supposed to have it delivered. pathetic
@usairways thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things i already bought.
@usairways thanks so much for ruining my vacation. i really could not have done it without you.
@usairways it is not like i am trying to leave earlier just for fun. i do not want to get stuck in dc if we have bad weather in rdu.
@usairways some flexibility on your part would be nice. this is why i love @southwestair. they're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
@usairways excited that i will be flying from syracuse to interview in dallas on friday for the fa position- this is a goal &amp; dream of mine!
@usairways thank you for reaching out to me. hopefully my request will be fixed and i can remain a loyal customer.
@usairways it does not take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
@usairways great crew for flight 504 phx to yvr tonight! friendly efficient. awesome job.
@usairways are people going to answer our calls?
@usairways pilot forgets to show up to work and ricky j (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
@usairways : you make the reservation; we'll make the excuses! #usairwaysfail
@usairways thank you for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out
@usairways is utterly unreliable! they did not schedule a pilot for their us624 flight out of seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
@usairways yes but again valuable time has been lost
@usairways i do not like being lied to. no bad weather in dc md va. i have been stuck in ca all day and should've been home by now. you owe me.
@usairways yes it landed at 11:40am. should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 minute drive. was assured i would have this am.
@usairways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and i was kept 12 hours without options in iah
@usairways cannot get back lost time
@usairways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in are faces. your fired
@usairways - thanks however i feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
@usairways my bag landed 1 day late flight at sfo at 11:40am. how can it be 10:01pm and i still do not have it? flight 719 2/22/14
@usairways thanks very much! i got through on the phone &amp; everything is fine. just love the website &amp; app ! thanks for working on it!
@usairways thanks for nothing. bought two tix through you to disney and my friend cannot go and now i have to eat the 400 plus 600 for new 1
@usairways hi. i am in lga but my luggage is in clt. have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
@usairways instead of fair treatment i got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death.
@usairways a few years ago i lost over 50000 miles bc i was physically unable to fly during the period. i submitted a doctor's note.
@usairways i have never been treated this badly
@usairways i am glad this airline is going to be swallowed by american!!! american always picks up the phone and solves problems.
@usairways three months and my miles have not been credited. no one is going to read the email i sent.
@usairways my email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- it is been three months and my miles
@usairways my tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com
@usairways the help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
@usairways no one picks up the phone all day/ no opportunity to leave a voicemail
@usairways no i was there 12 hours early! send me an email to share my experience you do not want this blasting here.
@usairways i open the credit card and earn 44000+ miles and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
@usairways you took the miles out of my account and told me that i could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
@usairways - i had 20748 miles in my account and was informed i would forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - i
@usairways - it is all automated and no one cares to understand the problem i am having
@usairways screwed me up big. first flight 1hr late flight. made it to second flight. csm daryl would not let me on the plane because we were (1/4)
@usairways houston hub aa t. employee the bag is not here it made it to pa before me! oops not your problem http://t.co/uld0hwfkfo
@usairways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket now card is on security hold
@usairways not yet. but we will see shortly.
@usairways i have flown us airways at least five times. every single time has been like this. actions speak louder than words.
@usairways flight from bhm delayed 5hrs! connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
@usairways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army short window to see him - no help.
@usairways honestly - how is it quickly as possible i have been on hold sine 9:50pm? everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
@usairways done it! process initiated saturday morning. cannot get information with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage. how 2 get update??
@usairways yay for glitchy tracking system! my bags made it to my destination and not laguardia like the app said!
@usairways really??? not one of them can book dividend miles travel - literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it is 11:30pm #noexcuses
@usairways yeah i know that but that does not get me my money back does it everytime i fly with you something bad happens.
by the grace of god i made it! “@usairways: @__rwg__ we do not have those powers in here. we hope you can make that flight.”
@usairways everyone is sorry. do not have what i need for meeting tomorrow. 140 charac. is not nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
@usairways is the worst. i have to pay $200 just to not take my first flight in a round trip! otherwise they'll cancelled flight my whole flight.
@usairways if it was so important why did i wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer? #disappointed
@usairways thank you i wiil write after call travel agency
@usairways terrible service
@usairways disgusted with your poor customer service. you wrongfully remove &gt; 65000 miles from my dividend miles and no live person
@usairways please hold flight us 639 in phoenix! i am a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues!
@usairways - no live person to speak with all day at dividend miles after they wrongfully took over 65000 miles out of my account.
@usairways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences late flightly. currently lost luggage. i want to talk to a real person.
@usairways yes but i had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there were not anymore for tonight...not fun :-/
@usairways well that's a problem considering i need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do?

@usairways you are the actual worst. you have zero respect for your passengers. i am officially done flying with you.
@usairways has the worst customer service line. i have called them 8 times today and not once was i able to talk to a real human being.
@usairways that was not the issue. someone finally helped on the phone. now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. smh
@usairways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
@usairways ... i f@$%ing hate you.
@usairways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont you refund
@usairways yes &amp; have already spent 1k+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee but the 50k miles have not shown up. want to fly aus --&gt; atl
@usairways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called you . you said you should call travel agency but
@usairways finally spoke with someone. i have to email the refund dept. i love you guys but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks.
@usairways yes with delta!
@usairways well i thought they had hours ago but just found out that no i do not have a seat
@usairways : was on flight 2046 bos-clt on 2/22 awful experience exit row seat was so narrow that i could not move my legs! unacceptable.
@usairways yes but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request.. 50 mins late flightr nothing!
@usairways not good. on hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wsgyckciio
@usairways expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a usaw flight but only issued 1. they are not responsive.thoughts?
@usairways no worries your flight attendant took care of it.
@usairways thanks for getting back to me. i called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone
@usairways i have been on hold for over an hour. not doing so well in the customer service department. #weak
@usairways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?
@usairways @joyadventuremom there are breastfeeding momma's watching this story all over the country! better work on a faster response :)
@usairways #dividendrewards urgently need to speak with a cs rep. my 50k miles havent shown &amp; i have fulfilled all reqs. flight booking problems flights today
@usairways i have been on hold for over an hour only b/c my cc miles are not showing up. what a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #switchingboth
@usairways i am a premium #dividendmiles #cardholder. unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
@usairways i bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont you pay back
@usairways @americanair now this is beyond ridiculous. some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain it is no wonder you had to sell
@usairways hi im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. the phone keeps disconnecting. please advise. website wont allow.
@usairways did a pre schooler develop your app? the thing crashes every single time.
@usairways and @flyknoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #noclothesnoinfo
@usairways on hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in denver cause of a broken plane. thanks guys.
@usairways #failingyourcustomer one by one
@usairways @philacarservice looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours late flight? seriously?
@usairways. yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? wow.
@usairways 1223.22 of unusable funds. will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers
@usairways @americanair can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
@usairways #noservice good luck trying to reach a human! twice sat on hold for over 50 mins... #neveragain
@usairways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. every time. on flight 5612 out of #clt to nola.
@usairways is it okay for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? i was shocked listening
@usairways good work by flight 1798 crew. #chairman's recognition even in coach. too many #missedupgrades late flightly. what's up with this?
@usairways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. bumped to @delta now &amp; having great experience. never. flying. us air again. never.
@usairways i cannot wait to never fly with you again. always delayed. always lose my bag. rudest people on the planet. southwest is the best
@usairways i sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. will this work?
@usairways sat on the ramp for 45 minute and missed my connection. no one seems to concerned at usairways.
@usairways it is very difficult to work with baggage claims when they do not answer the phone
@usairways i lost an id on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in cleveland hopkins airport. please help
@usairways i have better intelligendce than she does! she said plane is due in at 630. flightaware and your own app say 645
@usairways not likely flightaware says plane is still in durango and has not departed.
too little too late flight. you suck retweet @usairways: @mitchsunderland oh no mitchell. our agents are happy to offer you available options.
@usairways hi-i have a travel question. could you please follow me so i can direct message you?
@usairways should but didn’t.
@usairways just now but no general announcement
@usairways what's going on with us airways flight 805? why diverted to charlotte?
@usairways i’d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
@usairways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
@usairways seriously? every flight i have had the past 2 days has been delayed. every single one. terrible
@usairways i just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
@usairways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at phx b18? nice customer service.
@usairways very embarrassing.
@usairways i’m still disappointed that it is apparently okay for a flight attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
@usairways yes i know the industry procedure on baggage. thanks for helping..... 😉 what about the impossible connection that started this?
@usairways i agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hours
@usairways and despite tailwind… will still be late flight.
@usairways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. bad
@usairways thanks! sent you direct message re: baggage issues.
@usairways i have and you have not been able to locate them its insane. i trust you and pay you to look after my things and you lost them.
@usairways and yet the flight attendant argued with me over exec plat benefits...
@usairways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #itfits http://t.co/aurn07pwd4
@usairways has me on my toes whether i am going to make my flight back to boston tonight
@usairways @americanair need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason i always choose @delta #rude
@usairways @americanair explain how come i can get a free upgrade on us as an exe plat but not exit row seating w/out paying. confused
@usairways yes ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very late flight.
@usairways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to sea leaving the same time this arrives. is there a chance to hold?
@usairways i have submitted my request. i would appreciate a call by 9am eastern. thank you.
@usairways i need to email customer service for help and a question can you please provide the email address?
@usairways @vincesviews there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
@usairways can you help me out?
@usairways is anything being done to make flight attendants aware of aa member benefits? embarrassing being argued with. just happened.
@usairways i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. can you give me your email address? thanks.
@usairways @gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening in front of the scenes. #noaccountability #disappointing
@usairways 4 hours on tarmac in charleston and still cannot get a response after a week. unacceptable
@usairways customer service at its best! rachel s. took great care of us at the phx airport. http://t.co/hg7veqhghy
@usairways &amp; @americanair planes in #grandcayman http://t.co/gx7qbtckbr
@usairways i will never fly us airways again.
@usairways strikes again--late flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4. worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
@usairways can you follow so i can direct message you?
@usairways so i get bumped to the 6pm to birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled do not have enough hours together. fail
@usairways yes thanks but took forever
@usairways as far as being delayed goes… looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. good news!
@usairways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. my 2:20 flight to birmingham was cancelled flightled w/ no notification so i could not get on the 4:05
@usairways i asked if that was sop and they said “it is now.” but yet the other 11 flights nothing. is this a policy or not?
@usairways while i’m asking… 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c i was exec plat.
@usairways 24 hours of traveling and this just welcomes you back home to the us. 4 hr layover and i get to watch it going to wrong destination.
@usairways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9za6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
@usairways i am so disappointed with the service i received with you on my travels to nc these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
@usairways but question : if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/lft7qd23sy
.@usairways have you just given up?
.@usairways and then you said i could move my thursday flight for free if i call a number. and then you hang up on me.
@usairways are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (not because of weather i am in arizona)
@usairways your moveup policy really sucks. united has a 24 hour policy for this with status. i was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am...
great management of @usairways twitter account. thank you.
@usairways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
@usairways i am good. i just did not understand the terminology. but the merger brings new verbiage
@usairways can you privative chat to help chairman reroute
@usairways new marketing song? https://t.co/f2lfulcbq7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/wbhbljjks7
@usairways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways
@usairways can you help chairman? i am on flight 686 phx connect 599 sjc will miss connection can you reroute please.
@usairways your airway is a joke. i have never dealt with worse service
@usairways great. i just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me
@usairways it has been found thank you
@usairways @hhagerty that's a lie.
@usairways also can you explain why when i checked in on the us airways site &amp; picked standby for first i was not put on the list?
@usairways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. great touch. #poorservice @gma @cbsnews
@usairways your lack of customer service has shined. i need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. so they can return it to me.
@usairways do you operate any flights without maintenance issues? flights in/out of dca cancelled flighted this is getting old. update fleet pls!
@usairways and you took away my first class seat. love being a chairman preferred and assigned row 24 seat b middle seat
@usairways patience is what my connecting flight will need. why do you guys do this to me every time i travel? every. single. time.
@usairways plans changed! is that what you call not bein able 2 park on time planes w a 2 hr layover n b able 2 make your connection! #seriously
@usairways i have a receipt but no confession # for a thur flight. when i call for help i was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. help!
@usairways is it your practice to give first class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
@usairways thank you for resolving the issue. on direct flight to sfo from @united
@usairways would help if you flew bigger planes into tlh. all my team mates made it to the training but me.
@usairways okay thanks
@usairways no i am trying to get on a plane from phx to rno and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
@usairways she was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too. no help. #lostandforgotten
@usairways i have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. now i might not get on my flight till tomorrow? this is insane
@usairways direct flights to sfo leaving from same airport with @virginamerica and @united - can you please put me on one of those?
@usairways awesome... doors close in 2 minutes flight leaves in 17 minutes... and the plane just got here. wth?
@usairways i will check it out when i get to the airport. thanks.
@usairways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
@usairways - ha! flight to control delayed! going to miss connection. can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1xdlbibclp
@usairways thanks for the reply. on a good note the pilot nailed the landing. seriously. kudos.
@usairways on 5:55 flight to control to catch 8pm flight to sfo. but empty seats on 4:15 flight which was not offered. awful service continues.
@usairways i have to fly back to charlotte out of a different airport. you guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
@usairways i checked in standby for first class only to find i am not on the list. this merger is a pain.
@usairways 4 great flights with no delays! thank you!
@usairways been on hold for 45 minutes. is there a better time to call? this is getting ridiculous
@usairways your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the white house. dissatisfied to the nines right now.
@usairways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from charlotte (your hub) to los angeles (2nd biggest city in usa) almost $600?????
@usairways how does one downgrade a flight?
@usairways i am shutting my data off for the flight. i want some response by the time i land. you have 2 hours.
@usairways only happened because you could not get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags
@usairways i will never fly @usairways again
@usairways the exhaustion of traveling n runnin through the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road
@usairways offering to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. i am in a state of shock.
@usairways power trip. i felt completely threatened and unsafe and i am so angry. derrick bussey. dca. would like to reiterate that i was
@usairways thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving late flightr than the original flight i was booked on.
@usairways and i would have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and say we misunderstood each other until he went on a
@usairways look out for flying rocks this time! it is a bird it is a plane! nah never mind it is just a rock...
@usairways does not take into account the $450 it cost 2 rent a car 2 drive home
@usairways even if i was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth there is no excuse for his treatment of me.
@usairways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
@usairways this is no way to treat women. i want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
@usairways citizen. i fly your airline constantly and am so offended. derrick bussey. now im crying on this airplane because i am so upset
@usairways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. props to you guys. really making this the perfect monday.
@usairways we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright
@usairways am i allowed to carry on a suit bag and carry on bag? my suit bag will hang like a jacket would. it is soft sided 48
@usairways owes tammy from the winston-salem call center for keeping me as a customer!
@usairways the jetway because he felt i was disrespectful. i have never been treated this way particularly when i was trying to be a good c
@usairways with such disrespect i cannot even begin to explain. he has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
@usairways what happens if it is not located
@usairways i want to speak with someone immediately. i am shaking with rage. i offered to hate check my bag and derrick bussey treated me
@usairways so it is a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight?
@usairways is okay for you 2 cancelled flight change a flight when good 4 you but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
@usairways thanks but when i asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. now is late flight
@usairways hi guys do you have a general enquires email address please? thanks david.
@usairways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. sounds like you do not like being told how lousy your service is.
@usairways you idiots kept an on time plane on the tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
@usairways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? no thx.
@usairways following you now
@usairways sorry i did not realize i was not following you
@usairways please fix your reservations phone system. the weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days! #goodgriefpeople
@usairways i made it! thanks for the help!
@usairways - huge props to parizad at checkin in sacramento for her help on friday to get 3 of us home when other airlines were delayed
@usairways is there an additional charge for a golf bag with clubs shoes and golf balls if that's the only piece of luggage you check?
@usairways i have a flight voucher/confirmation code but there is no where for me to enter it on your checkout page while flight booking problems. please help
@usairways 1-2! rock hit the plane! in a delay now! never an easy day with us airways! ya never fail to let me down!
@usairways just an for your information i will be writing registered letters 2 your Chief Executive Officer and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
@usairways you guys cancelled flightled two of my flights yesterday and i checked the bag to huntsville and it went missing in philly.
@usairways if i apply for your credit card do you automatically get the companion certificate or do i have to wait for it?
@usairways customer service failure aside one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. i am sure tsa would.
@usairways i find it funny that @phlairport responds but you don't. your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
@usairways i get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. yet i know for a fact it was 5 people short
@usairways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to first class. can you help? phones are down.
@usairways i need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm i had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
@usairways @cltdouglas slowest baggage claim ever
@usairways do not blame it on weather. rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather. printed boarding pass too late flight. #takeresponsibility
@usairways too late flight.
@usairways delays due to refueling are out of your control? if that's true i never want to fly us airways again
@usairways @americanair shout out to diane at eyw for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little late flight!)
@usairways made it! just! huge relief - thanks for your help!
@usairways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? we only received 2 of 5. can you help with that?
@usairways im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times
@usairways it is 838. we boarded and we are waiting now to take off hopefully.
@usairways - thanks i hope so. maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-)
@usairways us 728/feb 21. arrive 7 hours late flight; checked car seat missing. no replacement available. has yet to arrive more than 24 hours late flightr.
@usairways you guys lost my luggage
@usairways us 728/feb 21 kim y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. wheels up ~ 1.5 hours late flightr.
@usairways us 728/feb 21 hour 6 on plane when us airways representative kim y enters deteriorating picture. unhelpful with no assurances.
@usairways @marvinatorsb thnk you for responseall flights were full could not get out until tmrw had to cancelled flight and go w/other airline
@usairways us 728/feb 21. ground power shorts again for the third time. weary german passenger deplanes. makes me jealous. auf wiedersehen!
@usairways us 728. refuel; we've sat for so long. pilot announces where the truck is. look over there to the left! actual announcement.
@usairways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from dca to san when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
@usairways @americanair trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving organic before she can fly.we're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception?
@usairways how can i speak to a human? need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! got hung up on 2x
@usairways us 728. one water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. applaud you looking out for the environment.
@usairways us 728. nope not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. one water run of the planet's smallest water bottles.
@usairways us 728 wait now a gate opened. back we go. (good maybe we can get off.)
@usairways us 728 uh oh no gate. now truck will come to us.
@usairways us 728 returned to gate to get mel sticker. oh look. we heard from pilot! no clue what an mel sticker is. anyone?
@usairways i spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
@usairways us 728 then lost ground power three different times. not only grounded endlessly; now without air lights entertainment.
@usairways us 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into gatwick not heathrow. moments of concern for all aboard.
@usairways us 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. more strange. now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
@usairways seat 8d on flight 545 last night is the worst seat i have ever been in. no leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/nuhplnxriq
@usairways one of your workers was very rude with us. we can tell you in direct message cuz it won't be any good publicity...
@usairways us 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. umm ok. a little strange.
@usairways my flight is delayed so i missed my connecting flight. stuck in philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? thanks for nothing
@usairways us 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. fine. understand.
@usairways can i speak to a human with some compassion? i wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic sorry email back
@usairways take a look at 1715. all f seats filled so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules.
@usairways back in line at terminal because phone guy could not help. one person in front of me 20 minute wait again? http://t.co/hqhdad7fvk
@usairways so you understand why i am resorting to twitter: no help available at gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
@usairways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on us5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
@usairways i am expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with us728 on 21 feb. check your very full complaint box.
@usairways what's the deal with flight 5268 from dca to phl? we boarded on time left the gate a few mins late flight and are now sat on tarmac?
@usairways stranding a student trying to get to birmingham in clt overnight w/o any help. you can do better than that. @av_duffy
@usairways really need help as soon as possible so please make it quick. thx.
@usairways well that is not going to help. i'vebeen on hold over 3 hours &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he is elite waa
@usairways hi. you lost my father's wheelchair. every time we call we just get voicemail. my dad needs it to go home. please direct message me.
@usairways 4 segments 4/4 delayed. gnv &gt; control . control &gt; january . january &gt; control . control &gt; gnv. my year off from flying with you guys was the way to go.
@usairways is charging me $200 to not take my flight. lol. that is the last time i fly with them.
@usairways yes. it says bag is being delivered. the local number says not open. asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
@usairways row 16 flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! i can run to home depot for the wd40 you if you need.
@usairways seriously buy some wd40 for a319 operating flight 634 from geg to phoenix. every seat squeaks w every shift. still on ground!
@usairways i would happily wait in the terminal near food restrooms and non irritated passengers.
@usairways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? over an hour &amp; the pilot does not know when we'll leave.
@usairways anyone there to help? still on hold...
@usairways oh yay! now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
@usairways site shows on-time but flightaware site shows delayed. trying to decide if i get out in this ice to catch flt 456 to phx.
@usairways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. stuck all over- no care given.
@usairways flights &amp; customer relations are extremely disappointing. faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. a joke
@usairways sitting here in phl with all of your rude customer service agents!
@usairways @americanair - can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? we should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
@usairways now on hold with customer care. wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
@usairways when will flt 445 get a gate at den? over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
@usairways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. thanks a lot asha at dca.
@usairways your delayed flight out of wilmington made me miss my flight out of charlotte. figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
@usairways wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at puerto rico airport! 👍
@usairways usually sorry does not involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. guess that's a club perk.
@usairways do not worry. used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
@usairways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold. sorry #minefits
@usairways horrible service wrong plane arrived many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight

@usairways i am in meetings in california and have no luggage!!
@usairways and the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? and the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
@usairways any way to get your call center to answer for a oneworld award? whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
@usairways why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? then not deliver it to me like you said? now show the claim as closed online?
@usairways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
@usairways how long for a reply
@usairways bag policy says stroller or car seat. we need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller. should i just call for details?
@usairways it was customer service like i have never seen before! kudos to your organization.
@usairways who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover? and what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? wow... #usairways
@usairways how do i get a hold of customer service? i have called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up

@usairways @americanair at 9:05am after the plane left: why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?

@usairways first the pilot was late flight now it is maintenance. this is exactly what happened two weeks ago. unacceptable.
@usairways there is nothing on my usair cc at this point but the email stated i would be charged. thanks for the reply.
@usairways i will never fly us airways or american again and i will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly
@usairways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life as a military family we do alot of flying..
@usairways @americanair - burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning.
@usairways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work what the heck me to get my flight changed to a late flightr date
@usairways &amp; @americanair what are your weight restrictions for carry on luggage? can find measurements but not weight restrictions. tia

@usairways thank you. the website crashing for me.
@usairways. on hold 2hrs after my flight was cancelled flightled &amp; anthony was beyond rude and not helpful! @americanair they're weighing you down.
@usairways will the nightmare ever end? just found out our flight today is delayed due to ground handling delays affecting a prior flight.

@usairways thank you for the apology
@usairways can you help me with a refund. the phone guy could not help. the website won't let me submit a reply.
@usairways we take late flight to a whole new level!
“@usairways: @hegshmeg o” thank you for that elaborate response
@usairways is your refund system down?
@usairways seriously. this is ridiculous. i should not have to wait a hour for my luggage after i land. #wtf
that's not the case.. they sent me a email with a link i will show you.. @usairways http://t.co/hb799cco0t
@usairways why are we waiting 40 minute so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
@usairways the only time i tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. flight 3841 to lga. i feel in jail
@usairways hello??? anyone there?
@usairways forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. why even allow it? #pissed
@usairways raleigh to chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. must be flying aa 'the screw usair elite after we bailed them out' airline
@usairways flt 419. 2+ hours late flight baggage + 1 more hr. now i see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #nothappy
@usairways then she had to get her own hotel so your agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
@usairways so she has to take a late flightr flight booked by her corporate (disney) travel department as your agent offered little help
@usairways your computer system went down okay that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
@usairways as the employee responsible for social media content yes you probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise
@usairways flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags are not here 45 minutes late flightr
@usairways. wow awful customer service.
@usairways merging with american will negatively affect your quality and integrity. i will no longer fly with you because of it.
@usairways how many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls?
@usairways you are the best!!! you are amazing!!! follow me please;)🙏🙏🙏
@usairways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? thank you.
@usairways 4469 thank you for asking.
@usairways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. are you serious!?
@usairways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. cannot say enough great things about our pilot. he is doing all he can for us.
@usairways what a mess caused by the computer systems. flight 719 in 3 hours late flight and now no gate for us. est 26 minute wait.
@usairways storm or no storm your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? i will never fly your airline again.
@usairways you guys have my luggage in san jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! please contact me.
@usairways i have flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime. this was my first and last ever flight on us airways
@usairways please get me back to tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in gainesville for this long😒
@usairways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that. go extinct. a merger only delays the inevitable
@usairways what was the point of the merger? why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
@usairways i love how just to give feedback to this link i have to fill out all my personal information on a form. you guys are the best :)
@usairways finally got ahold of an agent after another hour. thanks for the follow up. recommend a call back feature.
@usairways is this ringling brothers barnum and bailey??? should i keep my eyes peeled for the clown car???
@usairways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed because your computers were down
@usairways cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website. can you help?
@usairways how do i get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reflight booking problems?
@usairways please do not trivialize me. this is a joke not a slow day or slow experience
@usairways and how do you only have 1 agent at phx customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
@usairways sorry does not help. it is midnight pst. how in the hell am i still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
@usairways like i thought this was america. when did us airways start operating under the rules of communist russia?
@usairways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest. at least they treat their customers properly.
@usairways but nope! apparently this is the way you guys do business! i guess i am flying southwest and her blue from now on.
@usairways i keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to reno tonight.
@usairways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
@usairways and by the way i am planning it while i have ben waiting in the line at customer service in phx...for over an hour!
@usairways already planning my local boycott for washington d.c. area.
@usairways i can legitimately say that i would have rather driven cross country than flown on us airways.
@usairways and despite the fact i see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
@usairways you guys are the worst airline i have ever dealt with. no notifications no keeping customers updated. terrible service
@usairways hey guys! thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm pst!
@usairways @pdquigley any progress? good luck patrick!
@usairways @landonschott he is fine he really likes picking his own seat....
@usairways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
@usairways has to be the most lazy inconsiderate and unprofessional airline that i have ever traveled.
@usairways do you have any pride in your service? any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? or you just do not care????!!!
@usairways now you horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?
@usairways who's in charge of your company? my wife missed her connection to ca you sent her luggage on another flight
@usairways the call hung up on me..
@usairways got this message on your site to call about my flight - just gave up after being on hold for 3 hours! http://t.co/5cdx2roae6
@usairways #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!!
@usairways yet again your staff in philadelphia failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler
@usairways okay my fourth try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/ps9q9rpsil
number or email? that's the purpose of sending you a tweet? @usairways
@usairways thank you. i will do that next time!
@usairways it still says that i cannot check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly
@usairways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it has not left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #theworstairline
@usairways your customer service is horrendous. between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
@usairways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately cancelled flighted to give her a tuesday morning flight...no compensation. ugh
@usairways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
@usairways has to be the worst airline of all time😡😡😡

@usairways does not let you do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing you to get in 5 hours late flightr only to get to phl &amp; bag did not make it
@usairways and @americanair are not as merged as the marketing departments would have us believe. maybe @delta or @united can get me home?
@usairways absolutely worst experience of my life at phl. 6 hours 1 failed departure 3 gates and zero communication or help!!
@usairways @americanair as soon as i call customer service to speak to a representative i am disconnected
@usairways @americanair have been trying to call customer service since 9pm. after an hour was disconnected. spoke to no one
@usairways give us no information and an attitude.

@usairways are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! no communication from anyone. all of us dumped here.
@usairways question is why flight took off at all now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city
@usairways in a few weeks
@usairways #wronganswer. talk is cheap. customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again.
@usairways 4 hours . how do i change my flight that was cancelled flightled ?
@usairways you won't give us a hotel or food. can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city i have a ticket to?
@usairways actually it landed in bwi 30 minutes ago. she is stranded but i have friends to help. you failed big time on this one.
@usairways i have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. how much longer should i expect?
@usairways you landed me at #bwi instead of @reagan_airport and have no plans for me to make it home to dc. how do you suggest i get home?

@usairways i had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so i had what i needed. i am extremely disappointed in your service
@usairways been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. how are you going to compensate passengers #worstairline
@usairways it was your fault the flight was delayed to begin with. i should not have to check my bag if there's a bunch of space
@usairways it is an extreme inconvenience to make people check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. you lie so you're not at fault
@usairways stuck on the runway for 2 hours 10 minute due to weather in phl. nowhere can i find accurate information on #558 to bos
@usairways no more hotel voucher? everyone had to get one but not me...what do i do? arrived from amsterdam #snowstorm
@usairways yep except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done. #fail.
@usairways by far the worst airline in history. i will never ever fly your garbage again

@usairways depart from where? it departed phx and was due to land at dca around 8pm.
@usairways cannot stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. knew 11 people from delayed flight were on way in mins no compassion.
@usairways i certainly understand the hold delays for wx reschedules - i have been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time?
@usairways and cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed on time for 45 mins. still did not get half the luggage.
@usairways likelihood of phl to bdl actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far!
@usairways my brother &amp; his family stranded in clt tonight bc gate e36 agent would not hold plane for two minutes. now driving in bad weather
@usairways over an hour is unacceptable wait time. thanks for nothing. be sure never to fly you again

@usairways it is pretty hilarious that you want @sweetingr to finish his awful experience before doing something. make it right now.

@usairways @americanair flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. looking to resolve this matter.
@usairways i did at 7 pm! still no bag..
@usairways just spoke with a representative. moved my flight earlier. thank you so much for the follow up.
@usairways congrats you've just lost a customer for good. when i made a united weather change free/5 min. you guys 2 hours on hold &amp; $25.
@usairways so when was i supposed to call the internet desk? especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
@usairways not only did you lose the flight plan! now your flight crew is faa timed out! thanks for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #pathetic
@usairways i have been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. is there another number to call?
@usairways ...you are despicable! the flight plan was lost! now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! its a 45 minute flight!
@usairways hey guys just want to say i had the best flight ever! thank you so much. i fell asleep and actually had a wet dream.
@usairways can you help me update ktn on the profile? ticket book via aa &amp; that information did not get pass on. i have been on hold forever
@usairways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
@usairways you need to check information regarding hotels shuttles re routing flights delayed flights
@usairways i was eventually given a flight to memphis but only after i was taken off my original flight bc i was checked in as my father
@usairways how the heck does one get the internet desk to authorize a waiver? would that involved being on hold for another hour?
@usairways so am i supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #badcustomerservice #airlines #dividendrewards
@usairways &gt;250k miles on usair. last four flights not good. other airlines much improved. billing issues seats legroom in air service.
@usairways it says to call. before connecting get song dance about weather. weather bad 3 days? called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime
@usairways really? tried that already-got message not available to do. next idea?
@usairways i am glad you're sorry that i am homeless for the night. makes me feel secure.
@usairways but in the meantime i will be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st. thanks guys!
@usairways ah and i was only given one shuttle voucher so if i do ever get back to the airport you'll be getting the bill
@usairways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
@usairways but wait! they are booked along with all other hotels nearby. i was sent anyway to the hotel managers disbelief.
@usairways but do not worry! they found a hotel it is only 45min away. i got there around 11:30pm no problem.
@usairways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because i was not fast enough
@usairways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to go left to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. took about 20min to get there
@usairways i have a story for you. it starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in miami.
@usairways no worries i was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #themagicalstranger
@usairways -doing best??? think not. lousy way to run an airline. why no online way to connect? you be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
@usairways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is cancelled flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
@usairways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and would not even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
@usairways can you tell me why i waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho i was not allow to make change online?
@usairways @stephenrodrick your team needs to build capacity

@usairways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? no help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
@usairways now on hold for an hour. so frustrating i suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?
@usairways - the worst! hold time crazy agents horrible no accountability! #usairsucks
@usairways kudos to robin at @phxskyharbor lost/found for reuniting me w/ my ipad. she was delightful to work with!

@usairways you can thank supervisor jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
@usairways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until monday night. that's pretty awesome if you ask me...
@usairways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a sailor dealing with a death in the family
@usairways that's who i spoke to already. we've already booked another flight w/someone else. thanks for your concern. just wanted to
@usairways talked to supervisor jeanine and she could not help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
@usairways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. you guys are far worse. is @delta the only decent airline out there?
@usairways @keithlaw i flew us air for the first time yesterday got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story! #creditcardsales
@usairways 13 years of naval service and i run the travel department for all my commands...

@usairways them and @americanair
@usairways rudest crew member experience! throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
@usairways @americanair terminal e in miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. thanks for nothing.
@usairways i did &amp; was told i asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. should be easy to check when it lands in seattle.
@usairways cancelled flightled our original flight to aruba. now on the way home we were told we do not have seats. never flying @usairways again
@usairways here we go again. same flight as last week. delayed already 45 mins. think the 7:15 can leave phl before 1:15 am? #waitingagain

@usairways - delayed 1851. need an extra 5 minute to make 1769. would appreciate a little help again this week.
@usairways stuck on tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
@usairways not happening #worstairlineever also marie burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
@usairways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. personality/ compassion of operators = not. sad example of sad company.
@usairways you suck and you ruined my day. and my vacation is not even until june.
@usairways will do. maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 minute short of 3 hours so i guess there are none offered
@usairways yep check it and my gmail 'promotions' folder regularly... :-(
@usairways is a bag that is 23”l x 9”w x 12”h allowed as a carry on?
@usairways thanks for nothing
@usairways there is nothing tonight and i am on the flight now with gogo internet is there a way that someone could send me a direct message or email?
@usairways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let us hope this plane works. i am tired.
@usairways good information but am already signed up for all options. none of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails.
@usairways is there not a faster way to get me to columbia sc than making me stay in clt over night after my delayed flight?
@usairways thank you
@usairways and @american please get my plane together before i go to jetblue
@usairways it might have went through. no confirmation. please wait then same form.
@usairways found the tix# security code not working. tried a dozen times.

@usairways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?
@usairways more lies they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing.
@usairways i am enjoying my flights so far! you're doing a great job. today's been tough so thanks for making my flights comfortable.
@usairways look @delta has made the right call on cho. please evaluate. http://t.co/3khgjofgpx

@usairways - check-in staff at phx are awesome! great traffic control for general boarding.
@usairways batting 1.000! four flights in a month all four delayed!
@usairways sure just dm'ed you.
@usairways &amp; also that i was told no comps upgrades etcetera. reflight booking problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail
@usairways i was... 4 tomorrow. i missed my meeting today &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed
@usairways merging aa and dividendmiles yield an error. what are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? all i get is a computer.
@usairways #2066. was on plane from pbi to clt and knew about the frozen water. also saw a plane to new york city take off at the gate next door!
@usairways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of charlotte is it just my luck or what?
@usairways just talked to reservation. must congratulation to them. very friendly. good for usair. the only airline we fly.
@usairways i am just trying to establish what your policy is. thanks!
@usairways fight was delayed 3 hours in mco now i am stuck in philly with a standby ticket flight 4009. solution needed.

@usairways i have tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and i keep getting told to call back. someone please help me
@usairways gate agent in clt forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. huge inconvenience to travel plans.
@usairways it is vegas baby who does not have a good time in vegas laugh out loud
@usairways me and my wife will be flying out of atlanta to vegas on march seventh since could not get any out of tricities here in tn
@usairways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it is not worth it for them accommodate me given circumstances in bos
@usairways see? no response? obviously you think this service is acceptable. #customerservicefail
“@usairways: we're sincerely sorry sean. reservations is working hard to answer everyone's call and we appreciate your patience.” #false
@usairways absolutely
@usairways it was not weather this morning. awe1701 diverted back to bos due to mechanical issues. so far lost one of 3 days :(
@usairways i have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. you keep sending me to @expedia and they keep sending me to you!
@usairways @americanair no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at gate c38 at lga flight us626. irritated customers
@usairways how do i get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? i do not care how many points he has! he only has
@usairways we have seats. on phone iwas told i was getting error message due to paid first class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right?
@usairways waiting for bags now over 25min in phl bag claim!
@usairways awesome! flight #676 out of philly on tuesday. party in row 15 if you're interested.
@usairways flight is already over. i think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that vape is still smoking
@usairways call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
@usairways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. thank you
@usairways will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta
@usairways oh they saw it and said nothing.
@usairways yes but lost a whole day. frustrating!! #poor customer service
@usairways saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
@usairways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow. tried computer tablet and phone. got error message on all devices?
@usairways @americanair how do i merge my miles accounts? your sites tell me my information do not match even though i cannot find a difference.
@usairways yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service
@usairways can i bring mini bottles of booze on to my flight?
@usairways your staff at los angeles really messed up on this one. failing to scan my suitcase tag.
@usairways not happy with start of trip! cancelled flightled flight #poor customerservice
@usairways nice try. does not apply to philly.
@usairways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
@usairways thanks. no dc yet i see. i will keep that link and check back. appreciate it!
@usairways i am glad too. but i should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
@usairways will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of dca tomorrow afternoon?
@usairways how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor?
@usairways i called the btv desk; they had more information - so it exists. your systems do not make it easy for the customer to access it.
@usairways awesome! and yes @upinairclaire is!
@usairways that website does not give correct information said my bag was in miami was in key west the entire time..i got the run around for 2 days
@usairways was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. gave up
@usairways i just want to find my bag so i won't have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail
@usairways literally all that says is case open what good is that to me?
@usairways no you not sorry. i am trying 2 add a day 2 my vacation but there is a $200 charge just 2 change flights
@usairways melinda in reservations in greensboro nc is an absolute jewel thank her for me she's amazing!!!
@usairways the two women workng phl bag check term c @ 11:30 et should be fired for being rude pushy and treating customers with disrespect
@usairways best gagent in a long time - danny b. for us628 dfw-clt. appreciated how up to date he kept us during irrops. super professional!
we got fixed.
@sarahpompei do not bother wasting your time! @usairways will send you a form letter &amp; let you choose a gift certificate. #worstcustomerservice
@usairways thanks is there a beareavement discount anymore or not should i just book online
@usairways and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure.
@usairways -not just this trip been a few. your saving grace is your cheaper flights. now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines.
@usairways horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back
@usairways thank you!
@usairways i needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. no one could get us on a flight but i have since learned @delta had one!
@usairways yes i get that. i’m asking: specifically what will you do with the feedback i’ve given you?
@usairways delayed i am charlotte big surprise
@usairways cancelled flightled flight 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. you could've handed this one better. http://t.co/by3vdiosua
@andrewfallis same here! on hold for an hour &amp; then told @usairways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
@usairways what is happening with flight 1701 from bos to phl? daughter and her fiancée are stuck in bos!
@nrhodes85 is not it funny that @usairways just apologizes but does not actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #notimpressed
@usairways 2133. flight now cancelled flightled. have been rebooked on 2pm flight. if on time take off i will have spent 5 extra hours at dca.
@usairways we've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour waiting for it to be fueled. should not that have been done b4 we got on????
@usairways thank you
@usairways can i get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thanks
@usairways reservation agent on the phone did a great job.
@usairways get your act together start treating your passengers w/ kinder have more sanitized planes. take a page from @delta perhaps.
@usairways is a joke. stop losing my luggage!
@usairways can i book using some sort of breavement program? i need to get home for my pops funeral
@usairways i have been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of synchronized message when trying to check in what's wrong?!?
@usairways thank you. but i don’t understand. what will you do with my feedback?
@usairways has no idea what customer service means. as the customer if you mess up my plans do not treat me like its no big deal!
@usairways still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. platinum? who cares? problems checking in? who cares?
@usairways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
@usairways i respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 people who are already late flight? #youcandobetter
@usairways now i am on flight to fll and told to take a train back to pbi to get my car. there are no trains to pbi!
@usairways i fly quite a bit and it is not difficult to communicate. if agents let people know what's happening arrangements can be made
@usairways handled on the phone. unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip which is why i am so displeased.
@usairways headed to new york city from clt. funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
@usairways made it!!! send bloody mary's to row 27!!!
@usairways 5223 out of gainesville fl
@usairways i already let them know and sent 4 complaints. got a call back finally when i was asleep and there is no return call back #
@usairways thank you for valuing my feedback. what will you do with it?
@usairways the flights were not from this morning... it was 4 flights 2 on thursday and 2 on monday which turned into tuesday
@usairways i spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
@usairways your customer service is a nightmare. i have been on hold for 1 hour. i am a platinum member with aa and feel like it is worthless
@usairways never let us me down every. single. flight. gets delayed.
@usairways sitting on the ground in charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy friday hope i make my connection
@usairways done
@usairways made it.. never ran so fast in my life
@usairways i have been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for dca-pit. help! @americanair http://t.co/jaskyplwt5
@usairways thanks but you can't. my flight was cancelled flightled for maintenance reasons and the next available flight was too late flight for me.
@usairways yes i was rebooked the next day (weds). thanks. just upset that i lost 2 additional work days and paid for my own hotel. #losing
@usairways call gate d9 in clt and get me on this flight
@usairways suppose i need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. let me try that route.
@usairways 835 fix this as soon as possible
@usairways no. just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “we don’t care. we’re automated.
@usairways @americanair you cancelled flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from phl to ewr really?!
@usairways i am logged into a flight booking problems. i need to add api before travelling to the states but i cannot see where to do it
@usairways thanks for helping with #reflight booking problems #cancelled flightedflight yvonne anthony. you will help us get to telephone aviv on time. #happyfriday
@usairways big thanks to yvonne anthony from the chairman's desk. top tier customer service today. #outstanding #service &amp; #support.
@usairways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. this is completely illegal.
@usairways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjlzrywfj2
@usairways now siting on tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. this is so lame. sorry does not help. this is terrible.
@usairways what is the damn delay????
@usairways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. still sitting here
@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. cannot do anything once your original flight time has gone by. useless.
@usairways has completely wasted my work day! thank you for the bad service and bad friday!
@usairways and also it is great that you tweet @ complainers but what about the in-person help when i need it? robyn f. in manchester = useless.
.@usairways you'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. long story short: never flying usair again.
@usairways thanks for making miss connection getting rebooked missing that too and a miserable day. started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!
@usairways need to learn operations. sit a plane overnight at #gsp and not realize there's a mechanical problem. then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!
@usairways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. bad bad service
@usairways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
@usairways he overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. you should refund me i had no choice. #grossedout
@usairways i appreciate your prompt response.
@usairways nothing was available. male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. big guy was standby and probably did not even pay for choice
@usairways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
@usairways i did not want to hang out on your plane all day when i am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. unacceptable
@usairways does not seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in los angeles and you recycle bagtag numbers that does not help #usairwaysfail
@usairways this is a complete waste of my day. a trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. ridiculous
@usairways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
@usairways the plane is moving and it is no ice. we are moving to the end of the runway to sit because lga has one runway open.
@usairways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in phl! ⛄️☀️
@usairways nothing was available. male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. big guy was standby and probably did not even pay.
@usairways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. no way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
@usairways thks us #1786 2/19 phl to fll. overall first class has improved with more food now on phl to fll and most crews are super.
@usairways i want to not sit on a plane from dca to lga for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
@usairways this is so unacceptable. i am going for the day. now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. not to mention there is no air
@usairways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. they did not even let us off.
@usairways hi is there somebody available who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w us for more than 7 hours in 4 days
@usairways plus a us airways - you need to do something about this! i left philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pky7zhnnrh
@usairways ordered a scotch &amp; water and f/a asked if i wanted full glass or half? 60 years old and first time ever asked that????
@usairways yeah the mark was like a mile back. also we're an hour late flight. so thanks a ton for the great service today.
@usairways we got 1 drink then f/a sat in jump seat doing crosswords. glasses picked up at landing. just a very lazy service 4 first class.
@usairways paid for a choice seat my choice is to not have big man next to me in my seat too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard
@usairways first class no snack basket was catered so drinks only no preflight drink or coathanging first drink service 50 minute after take off
@usairways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at o'hare four hours after obama landed stop blaming someone else
@usairways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue we've heard it all! #letsgo
@usairways able? does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?
@usairways 1826 trying to make a connection to punta cana leave phl at 9:50
@usairways is the worst. 45 minute delay in boston. not weather relate flightd. going to miss our connecting flight. gassing up the plane issue.
@usairways is the worst!! still have not left.. everyone missing connections.
@usairways today's flight to philadelphia. it is a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it is not even snowing in fl.
@usairways i have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 minute on phone - still have not talked to a human.
@usairways can you help me reroute my trip?
@usairways gonna miss connecting flight.. delayed flying out of boston
@usairways @americanair i am in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
@usairways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance information for the past 30 minutes!!!
@usairways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
@usairways thanks for taking my flight off the board and not providing and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes late flight.
@usairways @americanair i am so going to miss us airways. you always provided great service and never let me down.
@usairways never again! worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3ddqq0gqni
.@usairways i rebooked myself - but cancelled flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. you started delaying at 1:30pm.
@usairways 7+ hours stranded in dca...zero apologies and the worst customer service. been a faithful traveler for 15+ years but no more!
@usairways this response does not correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
@usairways been at dca at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! absolutely worse experience!
@usairways it was 1838 almost 5 hours late flight due to mechanical.
@usairways never flying #usairways again. horrible experience terrible customer service.
@usairways mobile boarding pass email.
@usairways we will...sunday! just a few days away
@usairways i am following you now
@usairways unacceptable. you knew the pilot would not be able to complete the trip. wasted all of our time.
@usairways i have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still have not left the ground bad service #sad
@usairways then told to offload because the captain was over hours? this has been a terrible experience.
@usairways why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours late flight mind you) made to sit for 40 minutes
@usairways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? unacceptable.
@usairways offloading the plane?!?!?! this is ridiculous!!!!
“@usairways: @jdbwaffles we're excited to have you fly with us jb! when will this be?” spring break !!!
@usairways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. what's up?
@usairways that is actually not true! you can get a seat online after a big hassle. that policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #faa
@usairways i will. thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. 👌
@usairways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
@usairways that's incorrect. four people last flight of the night with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice
@usairways exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
@usairways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
@usairways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to choose a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors
@usairways i’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
@usairways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
@usairways worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. maybe you can help make it better.
@usairways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
@usairways please explain i have plenty of time since i am stranded!!
@usairways i doubt that its 11:21p &amp; we are still being held captive on the ground at dca! a little communication from up front would b nice.
@usairways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
@usairways 3935. sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. what is up?
@usairways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
@usairways does not want me to get home
@usairways they do not stand alone for me i bought tix based on usair confirmed flight. what good is confirmation if you change it anyway?
@usairways dca-&gt;hpn you are professor hostage takers.we stood on bus 2 plane for 25 minnow sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!
@usairways - i bet you do not but i am the paying customer here. i know how to check for flight delays thank you.
@usairways i cannot even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive forcing me to purchase a new ticket.
@usairways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving. flight 1137 has been awful
@usairways that's the first sorry i received from your company. the least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
@usairways never flying with you guys again. extremely disorganized and too many delays.
@usairways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in dca on their ways to cae for a golf week any compensation? #flydelta
@usairways flights 890 was the delay flight 5136 was my missed connection… help!
@usairways the flight that i did not connect to was 1857.
@usairways even when i do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
@usairways yes .not sure how you guys do not know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
@usairways wow! your miles program is ripoffquick ticket fee 75$ i hope you all end up on unemployment.
@usairways - bos -&gt; dca delayed again. this needs to stop. i will be filing complaints with the faa and consumer affairs
@usairways sitting on the tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. the level of service i have come to expect.
@usairways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
@usairways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. you are ruining people's memories! you should be ashamed!
@usairways first a late flight plane then missing flight crew then maintenance problems gates switched 4 times. you call this customer service??
@usairways due to your expensive change fees either. out of all the airlines we chose yours all do you could screw us. stranded!! no help!
@usairways we cannot afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home turns out we cannot afford to go home.
@usairways but it is not their fault because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. really?
@usairways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight and now we are stranded.
@usairways fa attendant on 4553 phl to pwm tonight was fab! an asset to your team. from 1f. have a great night team!
@usairways thanks for overflight booking problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 minute before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
@usairways we're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to dc for the births. thank you for the reasonable fares! see you saturday!
@usairways thank you @usairways! your fare to from dtw to dca was much lower than @delta and @southwestair! thank you! you won me over!
@usairways flight 728 from phl to london has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/no further update from the pilot. what gives???
@usairways i already have four times
@usairways 42 minutes holding. seriously if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe just maybe you're understaffed.
@usairways i submitted refund request b4 first flight 2 days ago. is that all i need 2 do?
@usairways i know that thanks. evaluate further ;-) ... -chairman
@usairways seriously??? i have shared my concerns four times already to no avail! geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer
@usairways no hot food on a 5 hour flight? crazy. could not eat in phl b/c our original connection was 40 minute late flight. what gives? #phltolas
@usairways seriously flight delay cinci to philly due to new ground staff miss connection to man uk and now have to argue for hotel. what the fuck
@usairways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. did not need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
@usairways i guess they only respond to compliments. sorry cannot think@of even one.
@usairways #usairways disappoints again! #cancelled flighted flights #missed appointments #promised refund is a lie
@usairways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! come on #usairways !!! ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
@usairways unable to locate baggage this is frustrating. all my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost
@usairways i already did. my question is why does it still say in progress on @askpaypal? it is been 6 days.
@usairways are you kidding me?? bad customer service folks. flew from psp to phx flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/kigfkvxxdq
@usairways thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to nola tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!
@usairways problem with flight in gainesville us airways 5137 to clt will miss connecting flight 5547 to iad. when can i get another flight
@usairways still no rep can talk 3 days late flightr. you are asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested. deal w this!!
@usairways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at rsw waiting for weight balance clearance. come on let us leave!
@usairways @askpaypal when will it be marked completed. i am scared i am going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded.
@usairways @askpaypal completed. if that's the case then why does it still say in progress on paypal's website. i reserved on the 13th.
@usairways @askpaypal so i contacted my bank. they took the money out today. i also contacted @usairways they said my reservation is
@usairways appreciate the calls when flight's delayed but the recorded message is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. i vote for texts if practical :)
@usairways horrible communication on delayed flight out of lga!!!! i got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! horrible
@usairways thank you finally got our bag. customer services reps were wonderful.
@usairways have a 6:05pm flight out of phl sat 2/21. snow expected. are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?
@usairways we got our bags today. thanks!
@usairways 45 minute hold time then a hang up by manager mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the us air cc and status.
@usairways never fails to disappoint.
@usairways platinum flyer bought tkt in aa. also both accounts are linked. so why cannot i check in for flight tomorrow?
@usairways your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
@usairways flight 500 out of seattle has 10000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. nice job guys - est 40min behind now
@usairways flight 437 phx&gt;ord. lead fa bill is the most professional fa i have seen in 9 years of flying usair. i have no ab cards. :-(
@usairways i miss you too. work has taken me out of philly. i’ve been on flight 1776 from bos —&gt; phl so many times i should have a res. seat
@usairways http://t.co/axryeiwzh0 vuelo24.es vuelos24.es sell too cheap mad-nyc with usairways. are they trusted webs or is it a scam?
@usairways @americanair total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. will not be flying w. am. air again!!!
@usairways pure anarchy on flight 555 to slc. people walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
@usairways @americanair you know...hockey sticks are expensive. your baggage handlers should not just be throwing them on the cart.
@usairways no problem. things worked out at airport. thanks!
@usairways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from seattle to charlotte will have connections held? or...
@usairways please change direct flights from ric to jfk instead of lga. pleeeeease! lga is the pits.
@usairways i tried it but doesnt help very much and reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
@usairways should take a lesson from @southwestair and wait for passengers from connecting flights. shame..
@usairways do you have a phone nbr for refund department ?
@usairways do you post travel alerts on your website? traveling to bdl on sunday morning.
@usairways yes it is a domestic flight. thank you!
@usairways can i bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? i feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
@usairways would like to see you do similar in phl! http://t.co/n9vge2npib
@usairways thanks! made it safely! http://t.co/kcqebeej7s
@usairways they say connections are good still...but another reflight booking problems is the last thing i need today
@usairways tells me to talk to @americanair about my delayed flights. aa tells me to talk to us. #ihatemergers
@usairways what is the holdup? should i be looking for another flight?
@usairways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay usair. not okay. this is ruining everything.
@usairways 4420 delayed further?
@usairways 25+ min. hung up. always awful having to call reservations there.
.@usairways i guess from now on i should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
@usairways 4 hours late flightr and i lost my conection 😡
@usairways just heard #monterey airport was closed due to thick fog any updates
@usairways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. aa platinum member.
@usairways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese vegetables olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix
@usairways thanks. if you have another method also that would be nice. appears to be a design flaw
@usairways yes. every one of these on every flight is like this. there needs to be more velcro or something
@usairways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on a330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/zl4bvexmcj
@usairways forgetting to fuel up? realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? one way to try and mask a delay.
@usairways your gate team are polite. but your planes are habitually late flight. in many cases passengers are waiting for the flight crew!
@usairways fuk you us airways with yo shitty chicken salad sandwich that so overpriced and you fuking make me wait in a 6 hr layover fuk you and
@usairways $75 for that uncertainty? i know you run an account; you do not create policy. but it is an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
@usairways is there anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
@usairways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
@usairways what the fuck is going on with the 1:30 from dc to bos? twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? total bs.
@usairways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. i will keep you posted
@usairways i keep missing my updated connections. need to make it to #jax to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
@usairways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight i was on. highly disappointed no medicine no clothes :(
@usairways wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6xedzvhh9 silicon valleys only 10 day film festival
@usairways @garywerk poor excuse. i was towards front of plane no sandwiches we have to pay for them should have more
@usairways i am not patient. i am annoyed. if you cannot book this travel online then you should not make people wait on the phone.
@usairways us airways csr at phoenix airport fixed the problem
@usairways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. looks like i might miss 2696 to montereyregionalairport need options please
“@usairways: @alan_bledsoe thanks for your feedback alan.” thanks but no help as i watch a flt lve w/open seats and i wait 3hrs for nxt flt
@usairways i do not think the us site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqiwuvt). can i use a us credit if i held on http://t.co/etfjqiwuvt?
@usairways laugh out loud me too
@usairways still waiting on a response
@usairways - who do i call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that cannot be rebooked online?rep i called quoted me $1k higher than the website.
@usairways so basically i am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. jetblue here i come. #usairways #mergers
@usairways how will i change it?
@usairways oh the irony. a dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! please send me a cocktail coupon statistical
@usairways @americanair when is us air switching to aa ios app? aa app is much better.
@usairways a $75 change is okay most of the time but if there are open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag why not let someone fly standby?
@usairways thanks to the gate agent in state college pa that was able to get me on an earlier flight and figure out an earlier connection!
@usairways i just think it is weird to have mileage as 666
@usairways flight 1783 clt to bos
@usairways some of my 4 kids are anxious. husband and i cannot sit with all 4 with current setup. no warning that our 6 seats changed.
@usairways but you guys switched me and did not inform me of the chathes
@usairways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice
@usairways your app is bad and you should feel bad.
@usairways still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
@usairways is $99 companion ticket benefit of premier world mastercard still limited to usairways flights or do aa now qualify as well?
@usairways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @americanair i hope you can fix it
@usairways only for one flight though. the second leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft.
@usairways yes thanks i have never seen anything like this and i come to yuma all the time big disappointment. there are 40+ still waiting
@usairways you will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when i get back home.
@usairways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
@usairways @americanair will you be destroying lives in eastern @gastoncounty during this lively little event? for profits you will.
@usairways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #badservice
@usairways @americanair been with us airways since 03 back and forth gatwick - charlotte then lhr. bit sad nostalgic way.
@usairways understood and i am sympathetic. how do i get my $100 back? i should not have to pay especially if you switched my flight.
@usairways we bought our tickets months ago. had seats together for all 6. have not changed flight. now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
@usairways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @americanair exec bene's not honored
@usairways no problem...just funny have a nice day
@usairways yes travel is complete flight 5095 from clt to cak february 18
@usairways cancelled flightled due to maintenance. the plane was there for 10 hours. get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy.
@usairways a year and every time with us air something happens. i sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
@usairways was switched to an american airlines flight not by choice and now i am charged $50 for bags? thought y'all merged?
@usairways my flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? i fly with @united and have no problems. i come the us 4-5 times...
@usairways @obj_3 even airlines are scheming to get a follow from objective lmaooo 😂😂😂😂
@usairways no i got to philly on monday and got to my final destination south carolina on wednesday. its not acceptable.
@usairways over an hour now and still no one at the yuma counter

@usairways @americanair i feel sorry for aa
@usairways there has been no one at the yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. terrible service!!!

@usairways #success made flight please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery
@usairways - so far so good this week. sav to clt boarded before the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). perhaps an on time departure?!

@usairways sorry i meant flight 4420 which was supposed to depart at 5:00 now says 6:30. what is the issue?
@usairways how about moving my seats to where i bought them 4 months ago? this happens far too often...
@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. also this plane smells like onion rings.
@usairways #tbt every day.
@usairways what's the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight?
@usairways got rebooked. sent to a9. wrong gate! traveled back to b13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated

@usairways thank you
@usairways another bad experience today. frozen pipes on 597. missing connection.

@usairways skys are sunny air is cold i cannot wait to get to #clt
@usairways never imagined it would be so hard to spend money through us air. stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.

@usairways we on on the flight from phf to clt. at the terminal but cannot get off plane yet. need to get on iah flight.

@usairways they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. please explain this issue?
@usairways my booked seat ended up being the last row which was labeled do no occupy had to play musical chairs for 30 mins. unacceptable
@usairways phone support rebooked but origination flt was late flight. made it!
@usairways kudos to your phone support and charlotte gate staff!
@usairways let us say it is directly correlate flightd to the chance of a replacement case. i know which would cost the airline less!
@usairways i do to as i have an afternoon conference in las vegas and i would rather plan ahead than run through the airport and then attempt
@usairways @hirasmusbidragi will try.. now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883)
@usairways i thought about moving a lot of business over too but first impressions count.. glad it was miles and not cash.

@usairways laugh out loud thanks to you we had to switch to american http://t.co/sl6bdrxfn8
@usairways 'preciate it but cant get off plane to speak w agent / wont come on plane 5015 knoxville...?
@usairways good ideas...she is traveling today...at airport. need to petition faa regarding silly 24 name change rule.
@usairways res went under her maiden name...married 50...no docs with maiden name. hence problem.
@usairways just called reservations. cannot change just able to put note on res. problem is tsa...
@usairways i am delayed in tys #5015 likely gonna miss my connection in clt to cun. gotta get there today. can you help me?
@usairways plz plz plz hold 4438 to eyw. the 810 phl &gt;clt is sooo late flight. gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th #gth239
@usairways by the way not upset at usaiways promise.
@usairways i hate you
@usairways it is the same passenger just her maiden name ended up as last name through online flight booking problems. yes understand non transferable
@usairways understood and so does us airways. getting through tsa is the problem
@usairways i paid for my seat. i expect to be able to use my full seat
@usairways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat what is my recourse? #nothappy
@usairways so i was just told i was coded as an upgrade... i clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
@usairways the gate agent said it is booked in full. sorry i had a ticket with a first class seat. i will call customer service when i land.
@usairways empty first class chairman cannot move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again!
@usairways can they change to correct last name? did via reservations already but said cannot change ticket name..
@usairways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. it is not a confidence booster.
@usairways checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1a - boarding today seat changed to 7f. how does that happen?
@usairways new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. new cannot get through tsa
@usairways cardholder is flying. we both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.
@usairways i received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included
@usairways if i paid for ticket with advantage world executive card do i pay baggage fees when flying us airways? wife traveling now
@usairways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
@usairways testing my patience this evening (or shall i say morning?). we waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent. 130am
@usairways flying from manchester international to philadelphia and getting emails about delays no information about connecting flights..
@usairways thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account.. a long incredibly frustrating day
@usairways no. other than being on my credit card statement i have not received anything from you and so i have no way to look it up myself
@usairways i waited on hold for too long. i should not have to wait on hold forever when i never received a confirm. in the first place #help
@usairways been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. your manchester nh staff is clearly your c-team btw. #notevenjv
@usairways will do :)
@usairways unfortunately i doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @americanair merger. #usairways
@usairways thank you. we filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow.
@usairways i did not cancelled flight my flight you did. than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags
@usairways - done :)
@usairways : i was told my ticket expired but i never recvd any notice before it expired .this sucks.i paid 40k miles &amp; $125 for the tckt
@usairways captain on flight 1712 from phx-phl at 3:55 tonight was hilarious. greetings from the pointy end of the airplane haha thanks!
@usairways just noticed that i do not believe i saw a confirmation for a flight i bought a few weeks ago. definitely paid though. #help #resend?
@usairways worst customer service. still not providing me an answer even after i drove back to clt airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
@usairways any plans to support #applepay on board? i have the usairways mc and it would be nice to still use it if i forget the card.
@usairways got through on the phone. usair cancelled flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it
@usairways i have run out of patience.. we are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
@usairways 3 delays 2 cancelled flightlations a double layover and 72 hours late flightr....could i at least get extra dividend miles?
“@usairways: @annettenaif we appreciate the #shoutout for roberto. direct message your confirmation code so we can forward your kind words.” sent
@usairways i did not take my original flight. i was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. did not get in til 5
@usairways sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca because your gates are full? early landing late flight flight.
@usairways #flight4592 let us off this plane!!! please go to a gate. this is absurd.
@usairways will i get the full amount credited to my account for us airways credit?
@usairways @americanair 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. just like last time. i pay for baggage to be transported.
@usairways lost our luggage. #yay
@usairways i found a flight i want on @cheapoair. is my @americanair aa advantage # applicable to earn miles on it since you're merging?
@usairways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at phl for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. why is this taking so long?!
@usairways thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #smoothoperation
@usairways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
@usairways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles to extend my ticket for last 3 days 20 + calls and i get a message to call back
@usairways really!??
@usairways how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to cincy is delayed trying to find her
@usairways my flight finally arrived in charlotte. they booked my luggage through to lga but no room on flight for me. what a mess
@usairways been on hold for over an hour still do not know where my bags are won't refund me my flight?!?! it was not weather!!
@usairways no your not!
@usairways my wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails is it possible usair cancelled flightled
@usairways thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay.
@usairways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
@usairways this is more than having patience. this is not acceptable. http://t.co/n7psuejdc8
@usairways please follow me so i can direct message you about something
@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; i have had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. freaky coincidence! plus side she's great. :)
@usairways landed safely everything worked out.
@usairways can you explain why i am on hold over an hour .other than i am dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
@usairways you used to have an evening flight dca-dsm and an early am return. now it is middle of the work day for both. inconvenient.
@usairways delays to the maximum
@usairways on sunday! cannot wait! see you then
@usairways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7mmq2f5fa
@usairways it should not take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
@usairways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day site unable to retrieve details. called twice and disconnected.
@usairways emailed them a week ago and still nothing...
@usairways i would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @allegianttravel does not! help!
@usairways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that i booked from. i booked on your website. unacceptable
@usairways still waiting! captain reports he is called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenlate flightr
@usairways is the real mvp for holding up the flight connecting philly to tampa.
@usairways finally rectified my flight situation! thanks again
@usairways so what is the difference between cancelled flighting and reflight booking problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
@usairways on time today and from phl! nice work! #thereisafirstforeverything
@usairways you have most likely lost my business. terrible experience! too many times stuck on tarmac and last minute cancelled flightled flights. #done
@usairways i have been doing that all day. cannot find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left lax.
@usairways why no ground crew at dca when we're already late flight arriving #evenlate flightr
@usairways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. you cannot even tell me when my bags will be here
@usairways ice cream up front! solid
@usairways shout out to the pilots and fc attendant(eliz) of us 673. super strong crosswinds during landing. elizabeth did a super job throughout
@usairways now telling me i do not have the correct tag for my luggage!!! my luggage apparently is not in la or charlotte. this is not ok!!
@usairways your software is broken. call customer support is not the fix. like i said earlier yell at your developers.
@usairways it is not double booked. i spoke with cs and we've got a plan to fix this. it is still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
@usairways is there nothing that can be done online to help? i bought these as a birthday present just trying to be able to afford a change
@usairways @americanair hey guys due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way i can get a checked bag credit?
@usairways delayed 2 days for weather and on top i got yelled at for being late flight when i was not notified of the time change #welldone
@usairways not a great experience for my first time flying us airways. going forward i will probably be taking my business elsewhere.
@usairways ...loosing a lot of business by using barclays. i cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in iowa.
@usairways i was re accommodated for my dsm flight tonight after a delay from myrtle beach now the flight to dsm is back on for tonight?
@usairways so far i have gotten six different answers
@usairways oh certainly. and now i have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. really happy that i was charged double.
@usairways i got an email asking me to checkin tmrw for a flight i meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @wallstslumlord @pkg49
@usairways what's going on? i have been hearing a not-friendly 'please wait' on repeat while i am on hold being transferred to I do not know where...
@usairways the captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around. that's not good.
@usairways i am sorry as well. it is been 24 hours without my bag and i cannot get a straight answers. i am on call #6 for today.
@usairways you all need to work on your online checkout system. two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. yell at your devs.
@usairways i wish we were on our way. now there's a problem w/de-icing.three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
@usairways if you could have ran your usexpress/psa worth a damn i would not be stuck in horrible clt now.
@usairways you run a piece of shit airline!! thanks for ruining aa
“@usairways: @annettenaif we appreciate the #shoutout for roberto. direct message confirmation code so we can forward your kind words.” confirmation code?
@usairways finally back on board. door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. you think someone wd have thought of it earlier
@usairways secondary screenings a piece of the plane missing... anything you want to tell us?
@usairways sitting on tarmac in #pit for 30 min. no announcement. just sitting.
@usairways my tsa precheck is not showing up on my boarding pass for my flight tomorrow...help!? #usairways #tsaprecheck
@usairways i appreciate that you actually monitor twitter so please pass along my feedback. i have tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :(
@usairways cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with you ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as division preference member.
@usairways i do not think i have ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
@usairways please improve your phone system! going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back late flightr = major fail
@usairways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. flight 5141 here early but short staffing means we wait on tarmac...thanks
@usairways the late flightr flight to charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier. that's so wrong
@usairways. i am delayed in cha will miss my connection in charlotte for lga. not good
@usairways we did. it added about seven hours to our day... so far... want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in kc? #notcool
@usairways @marciaveronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral and you hope they can find another flight. that's very considerate of you.
@usairways my last flight was cancelled flightled and i am very disappointed.
@usairways just lost a faithful customer.
@usairways i have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
@usairways marsha m. at myrtle beach is the greatest! she deserves all the respect and praise there is! #thankyouforeverything
@usairways. seriously attendants go awol for 60 mins. now flight further delayed. do not lite a match either http://t.co/mt8splm02v
@usairways joined silver preferred because i heard customer service was so great pity i was misguided.
@usairways it is just bad practice and i am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time i fly with you guys
@usairways well this is about as worthless as your regular service. a bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
@usairways ...these changes as well to late flightr find out that the flight i was scheduled for is not ready
@usairways after 3 cancelled flightlations and a delay causing me to miss connecting flight. another night not being home. thanks #pathetic
@usairways that's understandable my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...i changed my plans to accommodate
@usairways thanks! now i just need to locate where my luggage is!
@usairways we have not departed yet so let us not get too high hopes. but everything has been on schedule so far
@usairways thanks for showing interest...3880 to greenville sc.
@usairways your app sucks balls compared to @americanair
@usairways #usairways so my flight was late flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to phoenix thanks again last time i ever fly usair
@usairways thanks. suggestion: stop the promo messages after a bit and just run music &amp; a message that says call volume is high. #vrm
@usairways admirals club at clt has rude and ignorant front desk staff...@americanair you have fallen so far...thanks doug parker!!!
@usairways to clt from jfk nasty planes dirty seats &amp; floors rude flight attendants- hopefully aa can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile
@usairways i paid for my ticket on @paypal on the 13th and it still says pending. is that normal? i just want the money out of my account.
@usairways okay thank you we were told ground delay due to snow.
@usairways this made me have to cancelled flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew?
@usairways my flight was cancelled flightled yesterday and moved to today then while at my stop in dc my flight is delayed due to lack of crew us4485
@usairways looking forward to some friends and family time in arizona.
@usairways no they dont. i think i already said that. no one responds. its an auto response. wait is this an auto response??????
@usairways @americanair first class all the way!!💺✈️ headed to @portlandjetport http://t.co/kdmq0jps02
@usairways started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck
@usairways i tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we do not care
@usairways you see now that is a lie. they auto respond with insulting email. #sucks
@usairways your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help. i appreciate the hard work &amp; the push to b better
@usairways thanks for giving away my seat. another fine job! http://t.co/r7ibqr4cyd
@usairways @faanews how can i be stuck on a plane due to snow in boston when it is not actually snowing in boston? usair flight 2218 #us2218
@usairways i have been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
@usairways thanks.
@usairways you have cancelled flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...
@usairways i have a flight in saturday from mci to clt and there's heavy snow predicted in mci. when will you allow for changes?
@usairways i realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting cancelled flighted. please prioritize your passengers and help them
@usairways how does that help me when i get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks
@usairways @drvrugby team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - not happy! #blizzard
@usairways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. thanks!
@usairways stop cancelled flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
@usairways strikes again...lost bags. and two of them. #theworst
@usairways had 2 cancelled flight my trip to la bc weather @southwestair was easy but us air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. never again
@usairways what's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they do not scan it for tracking?
@usairways no access to dividend miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back late flightr. #frustrated #livepersonplease
@usairways you cannot even track my bag to see where it is. it is like it is disappeared.
@usairways cannot get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. it is been over a month since travel &amp; i have submitted twice online
@usairways i been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. this sucks !!
@usairways is there gonna be a better day to call? i have called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
@usairways i spent more on the room &amp; transportation then i did the whole flight
@usairways i ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that i had to spend
@usairways i asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
@usairways only to come home a day late flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
@usairways doubt it. gate 35x is a cluster and every agent encounter i saw (including one with me) was outright rude. just very put off.
@usairways i have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
@usairways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
@usairways so mad i cannot even believe you guys cancelled flight my connecting flight after i leave the first stop &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher
@usairways priorities should have been made. considering a pending snow storm why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? i would like an answer.
@usairways: i experienced what defines customer service on #flt1999. a flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
@usairways i have done everything. still no luck in finding my bag. i do not understand how my bag could have been misplaced. very upsetting.
@usairways that wasn’t my q but thanks. wondering why you’re the only ones. i disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uh6uwuosc0
@usairways turns into @americanair with such difficulty to past loyal customer. as a aa platinum flyer usair could not be more unhelpful. why
yes but i will nvr fly w/ @usairways i missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on ft1892 could not see my father be4 they put him in a coma
@usairways 40 minutes to put my tsa number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
@usairways so i would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
@usairways really so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks
@usairways thanks! can you help remind the agents it is ok? ps. heard rumors of a streaming wifi tv/movie service you might be installing
@usairways nope done. was supposed to get home at 9pm and did not get home until midnight. #neveragain
@usairways the only way to assist is to actually answer the phone.
@usairways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
@usairways would it kill you to not let 3000 miles expire
@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes i might be on hold?
@usairways a $100 @samsonite - totaled. not happy. not at all.
@usairways i have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
@usairways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is i do not really know what happened
.@usairways thanks!
@usairways my number is 214-725-1966. cant wait...lol #usairsucks
@usairways have him call me. i cant wait to see if anything happens. your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
@usairways she also appreciated having her very own hashtag! :) #lucycat
@scm1133 @usairways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7stktjxan1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...)
@usairways big fail on not having curbside baggage in pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
@usairways is it possible to earn dividend miles for a passenger that is not me even if i am purchasing the tickets?
@usairways i hope so too. thank you for your help. she traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase.
@usairways would you consider honoring the original fare price if i were to try flight booking problems the ticket again?
@usairways booked an award ticket recently now same ticket is less miles. how do i contact you without using the online form or phone?
@usairways you are the best!!! follow me please;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
@usairways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices. goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
@usairways that's okay just know that i will most likely never book with you again
@usairways i followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around. your service sucks #usairwayssuck
@usairways i do not mind waiting i mind waiting on a plane when i should not have had to. the airport has more room and you know.. food!
@usairways that is appreciated. however the system tells you call back late flightr then ends the call. no need to reply thanks.
@usairways why would you board people on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? why would you have people then wait through the hour long process?
@usairways i tried that before using twitter. also gave me no helpful information. thank you anyway
@usairways i am sure you are sincere in your apology its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options
@usairways yeah i know that...but now i will have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
@usairways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
or just days that end in 'y'?
@usairways there is not a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
@usairways do families no longer get early boarding with young kids? american your new parent gives it to us...
@usairways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
@usairways your agent did not say
@usairways no they could be at laguardia jfk or charlotte. i have no idea where they are now tho
@usairways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? update in policy?
@usairways it is the second person when i called again to ask could not catch her name rejected the request
@usairways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
@usairways that link is broken. but if it is the online baggage locator i already tried it and it gave me no useful information.
@usairways spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times but no resolution. i am still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up
@usairways thanks for reaching out to me. my gold division no. 2k424j0. my flights were changed under confirmation # dnx58v.
@usairways stranded in philly- #starving and cannot get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue / next flight in 10 hours
@usairways on hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 minute &amp; counting
@usairways yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it is not flailing about. http://t.co/jhxwmutx4g
@usairways link does not work and i have tried tracking my bag several times. still does not clarify where it is.
@usairways thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. this flight is significantly better now!
@usairways thank you!!! on our way to get her bag now - thanks to having that number 😊
@usairways how do you give stand by seats to ticketed passengers who you know have a connecting flight ?
@usairways would you guys please send service agents to gate b15 in philly? all the people missed there connections and there's only 2.
spend 1 hour on hold with @usairways .
@usairways why would a flight arrive late flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have a connection?
@usairways last 2 times i checked a bags they were severally damaged. no one answers the baggage call line for status? #chairmanlove
@usairways this is crazy. have not spoken to a human yet. there has to be a better way. http://t.co/meoalcipdd
@usairways can i get assistance on flight #611? plane just landed from hpn and i have a connection to atl.
@usairways you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... i was living in an airport you offered no monetary assistance!
@usairways i have been trying for days! and i do not get hung up on until after i get through all the prompts. what am i to do??
@usairways why not have an option for a call back? i am just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed.
@usairways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. charge me double for flights and cannot even fix it. worst service i have ever had
@usairways i have been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. really? a global company? help!
@usairways also we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights plus $200 2 change flights even for emergencies.
@usairways where's my apology?
@usairways thank you. but it is sad that she could not talk 2 a real person &amp; kept getting disconnected by an automated msg.
@usairways flight today showing on time online not able to check in. called &amp; told was cancelled flightled put on hold over an hr ago. help?
@usairways new tag line but we got you there alive!
@usairways 2 days in a row i call and still cannot get anyone on the phone. do you actually have any employees?
@usairways announced that people going to fl via charlotte would have to go to a different plane &amp; gate but it was a 'direct flight' #logic
@usairways just realized my @americanair advantage number was not used for my flight. how do i get my ff miles?
@usairways does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$?
@usairways is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? need help flight booking problems an award flight.
@usairways flight is delayed 5 hours. no reason given. sure love flying with your airline. #whatajoke
@usairways so we got her home now we just need her bag. is there a direct desk number for savannah?
@usairways i hope so. last i spoke to the baggage team... they were not sure what city my bag was in.
@usairways thank you busy times.
@usairways my flight was delayed and rerouted and not so much as a sorry for your inconvenience from the check-in agent? #notimpressed
@usairways @americanair 90 minute delay thanks to maintenance issues. thanks for wasting a day.
@usairways thanks :)
@usairways thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your cancelled flightlation. #usairways

@usairways hey! i booked a flight (isabelle gramp boston to lax) and it said that it charged my credit card but the transaction did not go
@usairways you are amazing!!! follow me back please!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
@usairways i have been on hold with your divident miles service desk for 45 minutes and that's after being hung up on the first time.
@usairways is useless airways. day 2 trying to get home on standby as a result of their cancelled flightlation. #usairways
@usairways for a response in 3-4 days? no thanks
@usairways will never travel with you again. this is insanity. storms are inevitable but making us hold to just add a lap child #badservice
@usairways any word on flight 1748 getting out of dfw in the near future? stuck on plane at gate for over an hour
@usairways thanks so much!
@usairways i recently moved and got a new license and when i booked my flight months ago i used my old license do i need to change that?
@usairways no this is a systemic problem. mail comes from 153.69.214.203 but usairways spf record disallows it. direct message me for more detail
@usairways little help to us! my husband has been on hold for an hour for something that take 5 minutes to complete.
@usairways i recently moved and got a new license and when i booked my flight a months ago i used my old license do i need to change that?
@usairways we might need a plane to get somewhere but just remember that you are not the only choice #makeovertime#customerserviceplease
@usairways still cannot get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes
@usairways has an spf record error that is causing e-mail from noreply@usairwaysmobile.com to go to spam filters. dns administrative needs to fix!
@usairways you are the best!!! follow me please;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
@usairways so the seat next to me (19b) on flight 1943 to seattle has a tray table that is falling off... http://t.co/haj5lkqjw4
@usairways second time this occurred in 3 weeks. i am not patient. i have no choice. #antitrust issue
@usairways my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from usairways. i will never use them again or refer anyone!
@usairways credit to my bank account for the two days of work that i have missed because of these cancelled flightlations.
@usairways i do not need to rebook i need to know the policy
@usairways no reflight booking problems necessary. i cannot afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. i would however like some type of credit.
@usairways what are the odds you can get me on a flight with delta so i can actually get to orlando today?? #2dayslate flight
@usairways we're all standing here and no one is saying anything. i will most likely be missing my flight to bwi again. http://t.co/jhau4k48yv
@usairways how long does it take to receive ticket # from @americanair for itin booked via http://t.co/79wajk7eyt on us flights?
@usairways that is the most useless tweet i have ever seen out of you.
@usairways this is got to be the worst service i have ever seen with an airline. 3 cancelled flightled flights. rude employees. currently flight delayed
@usairways so you're going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that's part of the problem
@usairways now over 2 hrs. cannot wait anymore. 2 hours for nothing. now what?? #frustrated #usairways http://t.co/buwjtvuwkm
@usairways i have called for 3 days and cannot get thru. is there some secret method i can use that does not result in you hanging up on me?
@usairways what is policy on changing flight to different dates once your flight has been delayed?
@usairways i just checked in online for tomorrow's flight - thought i should get auto upgrade? (already got the email saying no seats)

@usairways tell the flight from clt to srq 5080 to wait!!!!!!
@usairways @bohnjai they lost my bag @phl baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera
@usairways if there are empty first class seats on my flight at check in why would not i be automatically upgraded?
@usairways thanks means a lot after i was verbally cussed out charged extra for a bag &amp; then told i do not feel like dealing with it 😒
@usairways stuck in cae need reflight booking problems for next flight possibly direct message for more information

@usairways i totally understand the weather. just frustrated. thanks!
@usairways tell them to get on that please.
@usairways @sdfairport i really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved
@usairways gate agents are now working with everyone to resolve connecting flight issues which is my concern

@usairways thanks to gate agt john pascucci for finding us a flight from clt to pvd after our original one was cancelled flightled http://t.co/yiwlhqhzgp

@usairways you are the best!!! follow me please;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
@usairways please do not go to the check in process @americanair uses at #mco. it is an absolute disaster.
@usairways how about a phone # to talk to a real person?
@usairways over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. had to rent a car and you still have not helped us
@usairways i gave up http://t.co/2edgc6tbls
@usairways i have been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. how can you possibly do business this way?
@usairways lack of communication with other offices the customer &amp; you all never update your systems. you guys are 2 established 4 this mess
@usairways you guys get too much $$$ and too many customers to be fucking up as badly as you do
@usairways after last night in charlotte nc i am seriously debating never flying you again. 50 minute on the tarmac connection leaves.
@usairways hi! could you protect me on us 445 just in case? still on ground with no checked luggage but still a chance i can make original
@usairways great but that still does not help me..
@usairways @forsyth_factor hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go
@usairways why did not you reroute bos to jax via dca through clt instead forcing an overnight @dca #passengerslose
@usairways i appreciate the hard work. still i gave up after &gt;hour. @dsearls
@usairways my luggage was delayed. i am looking for compensation since you know you charged me for it then forgot it...
@usairways @americanair stranded in cold texas and getting sick because you overbooked the flight and gave my seat away. #gooutofbusiness
@usairways worst experience ever. unable 2 help over phone and told at last minute cabin crew unavailable for flight. never again #usairways
thanks. “@usairways: @fispahani weather disruptions have caused some of our crew to run late flight. we're sorry for the delay to your flight.”
@usairways 325 minute delay - this is absurd. feel free to provide credits... http://t.co/e09kej9bv1
@usairways fuck you
@usairways not even on your dime and free tickets. #worsttraveldayever
@usairways disappointment? making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from usair is maddening.
@usairways thank you
@usairways thanks. we did see an agent. unhelpful. some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons.
@usairways 25 mins after the scheduled departure and still sitting in terminal. communication would be lovely... http://t.co/pkaxunyfn2
@usairways this day has been a disaster rude employees no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; i fly alot! dallas=raise=now!
@usairways traveling with 2 year old. would appreciate you holding up your end of good business and hosting us in our unanticipated layover.
@usairways missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. yet no voucher on your part? #fail
@usairways of course never again tho . thanks for tweetin your concern but not doin anythin to fix what happened. i will choose wiser next time
@usairways i absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in phoenix. totally false was a crew issue.
@usairways half an inch of snow in charlotte #overwhelming
@usairways on the phone now. looks like global
@usairways already filed a report personally at the airport however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number.
@usairways already called no other options flight is being reimbursed. never again you are unreliable for business travelers.
@usairways your saving grace was our flight attendant dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to delta where i would see him again
@usairways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone. good job shocking that your airline is folding.
@usairways my flight (us558) got cancelled flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.i was told that i would be reimbursed for hotel. who do i contact?
@usairways no need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . there is no up date i have landed but was suppose to land at 5
@usairways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. promises does not make up for it
@usairways my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to al. she's only getting to nc now. are you kidding me #neverflyusairways 👿
@usairways she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them
@usairways you are the best airways!!! follow me please;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
@usairways 5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . is that even real life ? get me off this plane i wanna go home 👠👠👠 (3 heel clicks)
@usairways flt 4439 is on the ground but you do not have a gate for us at dca. why is this happening?
@usairways shout out to the red-headed gate agent for flt 3389 from dca to chs at 7:10 tonight. did not get her name but she was great!
@usairways i am sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether
@usairways now the jfk baggage office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour
@usairways dude named shaquille at the desk in charlotte was incredibly professional and helpful vs. some crazy angry people tonight
@usairways really you gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her
@usairways awesome usair tysvm &lt;3
@usairways thank you!
@usairways that would be lovely! you have great people working in your organization.
@usairways only the jfk baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on cancelled flightled flight 3121 to dca. shameful.
@usairways hey let flight 1874get to the gate hours late flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board
@usairways me too. me too.
@usairways a flight update does not help when we are waiting 20+ minute at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. who can i write?😑
@usairways thank you very much usair happy night@ &lt;3
@usairways thanks! it is hectic for everyone but their actions do not represent the company well imo
@usairways @husainhaqqani mr. husain you shld protest as well when one of your party member rehman malik delayed a pia flight for hours..???
@usairways not good. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious
@usairways i am sure you do not but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. tks.
@usairways not too impressed with your airlines but i would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow
@usairways glad to be home and that your great people got me home safely. sad for others who did not get back bc of scheduling problems.
@usairways how about an update? 2hrs delayed this obviously isnt up 2 date havent boarded http://t.co/l7lwjazioa
@usairways @noltnancy what will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail

@usairways will do. i appreciate the response.
@usairways @erickofiejones how long are billing cycles
@usairways on hold for 1:23. all because they won't let me use a companion voucher online http://t.co/dphqrgkdoa
@usairways and no one has been at all helpful. i will never fly this airline again. #neveragain #spreadtheword
@usairways no they won't because after 5 hours of holding i had to give up because i could not borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours...
@usairways i have been sitting in the charlotte airport for 4 hours. waited for crew and now maintenance. #neveragain
@usairways delayed my flight 3 times before cancelled flighting it had angry and rude workers and are now providing no helpful service at all
@usairways my daughter is stranded in charlotte because us airways cancelled flightled her flight tonight. completely dissatisfied with @usairways
@usairways thanks to kevin and team at f38ish at phl for some great service recovery tonight. appreciate it.
@usairways commitment to excellence is 2b praised. can get you to the wrong city 2 days late flight or the right one 3 days late flight. #customerservice
@usairways car services to and from the hotel food hotel cost bc of cancelled flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications
@usairways i am amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers.
@usairways when i told csr i would close account he could not care less
@usairways beware barklays bank has terrible cust service. will not assist only know to go by badly written book(in english).
@usairways they call weather an act of god and refuse to help. i have my wife and 3 kids and they have no sympathy.
@usairways bad weather should not mean bad service
@usairways stuck in charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.
@usairways flights keep getting delayed and cancelled flighted with no information worst customer service ever.
@usairways what does your reservation is 'out of sync.' mean? on hold w customer service 12 minute and want an idea what is up
@usairways sits on a throne of lies
@usairways where's my bag? you called at noon promising it today would like an update like your website promises. i need that bag!
@usairways flt 470 tampa to clt is very late flight gonna miss connector to bos what can you do?
@usairways i am on the flight finally in the air. not enough food to feed customers. no movie or entertainment on a 5 hr flight.
@usairways i just hope that pilot had a good day off
@usairways thanks for your help! i left a message for dca lost and found. fingers crossed we find it!
@usairways is the worst airline i’ve ever flown on. you guys have treated me like garbage today.
@usairways only water on flight 763 to dca? this is the first time i have ever seen this happen. #executiveplatinummeansnothing #iwantcoffee
@usairways eh it happens. i think i will survive. 😉 thanks!
@usairways i have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. i thought i had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. is that not true?
@usairways i did but it won't help.. cannot believe you would not take full fare for first class and gave away to platinum member.. profits?
@usairways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
@usairways - i am in the cust svc line. your charlotte nc agents better be in their a game.

@usairways i would be on my way but wether has delayed yet again.. love the charlotte ice storm!! good luck with mad customers
@usairways please staff your flights approproately. our entire flight is delayed because fa isnt here. i shouldnt have left delta...
@usairways tooooo many cancelled flightations! my chain of command hates me now
@usairways you cancelled flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @usairways #neveragain
@usairways i just think if i am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight i should not absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
@usairways that's why you guys are my #1 choice.
@usairways thanks. 😒
@usairways i’m cool with weather delays etcetera. but lying and deceiving passengers to keep them from changing is reprehensible. #yousuck
@usairways i just want to get home before wednesday... joke is over 50hrs of cancelled flightlations and delays is enough!
@usairways how about a drink voucher for the next flight?? #winkwink
@usairways nice touch with using my first name. very intimate. i will be filing a claim soon to be reimbursed. have a us airways day!
@usairways the airline is embarrassing itself. i get that bad weather is not your fault but your response to it could not have been worse.
@usairways any updates on flight 5202 from orf to phl no one at gate... ;(
@usairways 2.5 hours late flightr and the flight has been cancelled flightled. you gotta work on your internal communication skills.
@usairways had a horrible experience flying from montego bay to philadelphia on 2/11. $125 2check a golf bag constant selling in-flight
@usairways told no gates open at #ord needed to wait 20mins. still waiting after about 4 mins.
@usairways and it is 3:22 with no sign of boarding.... can i please get another update?
@usairways still cannot get a real person on the phone to book a flight. ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks

@usairways great job communicating to the passengers! flight 1855 does not exist anymore? http://t.co/hlzahxkdsn
@usairways thanks travis at phl a east checkin for knowing baggage policies. skis &amp; boots count as 1. teach your mgr who did not know
@usairways thanks for responding :) when bags came there was mad rush towards end of jetway—why not just put through baggage claim?
@usairways @americanair we are on us/aa flight 4443.we arrived at dca at 2:12. waiting on our gate (33)for apx an hr now. no update?
@usairways have an agent with reservations contact me instead of asking me to waste my time by sitting on the phone for hours
@usairways if you believe in keeping your customers happy especially after a mistake was made on your part...
@usairways would love to combine aa and usair accts. unfortunately one has my middle name &amp; one has middle initial. won't allow change
@usairways i had a rep 10 minute in who said she could not help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service

@usairways the phone number the gate gave me does not work either. what is your customer service phone number?
@usairways done
@usairways @jack_kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. this was allowed at pit but not bos. how does that make sense?
@usairways never in my life have i dealt with such poor customer service irresponsible staff and lack of care lga-iah day 2 baggage in nc?

@usairways i did and it is been a disaster. you had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh

@americanair thanks for getting back to me. but i will find other airlines in the future.
@americanair why would i pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that are not even worth $200?
@americanair stranded for 24 hours in mia patrick casimir has been the only aa staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal

@americanair worst company ever please do not fly with them i repeat please do not fly !! they will not credit you if you're delayed
@americanair continues to win: i have never missed a flight before but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. sheesh.
@americanair - keeping aa up in the air! my crew chief cousin alex espinosa in dfw! http://t.co/0hxlnvzknp
@americanair lost my cats missed their flights kept them crated 30 hours for a would-be 5 hr trip. you'll never touch my pets again.
@americanair do not worry you won't steal my money again
@americanair why am i continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your platinum desk?!
@americanair pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/acebo6elpa
@americanair i am looking for help on usairways award travel booked for wife and two boys no seats assigned.
@americanair @clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... no biggie 😄
@americanair and @itunesmusic have put me in bad mood. i have not been this angry since spagnuolo coached the #rams
@americanair and they cancelled flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. i slept in an airport for a night-_-

@americanair great thanks!
@americanair awesome. thanks!
@americanair my flight 386 to dallas from jacksonville fl has been cancelled flightled. no one has notified me. what's going on?
@americanair extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
@americanair flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22 had no gf meals despite my early request attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice
@americanair but what i can always rely on when i fly usair or american is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
@americanair robocalls me with another cancelled flightation. and then when i don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. just wow.
@americanair said that aa does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to china based on some federal laws but united does why is that?
@americanair right. but more than two hours late flight and it seems due to poor communication which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
@americanair i am not sure what happened to my usairways status when the merger took place.
@americanair can you help rebook passenger via twitter/dm. been on hold for 1.5 hours. thanks!
@americanair i would like to apologize to the gate agent for flight aa76 i was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
@americanair my key point of confusion is whether i can make this change even though the initial flight booking problems was on us airways metal?
@americanair origin/destination/dates are the same. going from us airways connecting flight to aa direct flight. award is saver level.
@americanair when will the old 777-200 fly ord-pvg get upgraded?
@americanair i know. just a little cold weather humor. :)
@americanair none of the #lax flights into #dfw have been cancelled flightled. those landing before and after ours are fine. completely arbitrary.
@americanair that does not really answer my question. maybe if i provide more details you can give me clarification...
@americanair this delayed bag was for my friend lisa pafe. she got her bag after 3 days in costa rica. issue no updates on your system.
@americanair thanks!

@americanair we are off to kax premium. hoping this flight is better food tv now i know how to work it and service. thanks
@americanair @beantownmatty sounds like a date!
@americanair i am frustrated by all of the @usairways attitude toward #execplat members. #thenewamerican
@americanair another day another grievance with this airline. no customer service
@americanair you've misunderstood. @usairways would not do a same day flight change for me. the gate agent said no.
@americanair flight 35. i am on my way.
@americanair car accident on my way to the airport. missed flight from rno to dca. trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait

@americanair so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@americanair any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @usairways? i was told a few days over the phone - but it is well past that.
@americanair i was happy to purchase the upgrade. if only it was available on my next flight.
@americanair it is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you did not care
@americanair fourth flight rebooked to is not cancelled flighted! woo-hoo. going to make it to @laguardiaair
@americanair my flight to dfw from lit on my way to pdx tomorrow was cancelled flighted. can you help me?
@americanair the issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so late flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@americanair i understand. but why is this the only flight of the day not going out? twice?! i am now out of extra medicine and diapers for baby.
@americanair i sure do. i am running version 3.10.0
@americanair you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@americanair @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
@americanair fyi...call stilling getting dropped. after an hour of continuous dialing. attempted to cancelled flight online but not able to. help!!!
@americanair how can i get you guys to respond to my tweets and dm??? really sad feeling to be ignored.
@americanair @souljacoy what is aa going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? you won't even answer the dang phone!
@americanair 800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. very frustrating. cannot talk to humans.
@americanair i want to speak to a human being! !! this is not an obscene request!
@americanair no response to direct message or email yet. customer service?
@americanair should reconsider #usairways acquisition. flight 1843 aa gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@americanair thank you.....you do the same!!
@americanair - how long does it take to get credit to my aa account? traveled in january &amp; only one leg reported. asked for credit no response.
@americanair hopefully you ll see bad ones as opportunity to get better and not dwell in it... and the good ones as encouragement words!
@americanair okay i think 1565 has waited long enough for a gate at dfw...
@deltaassist now at 57 minutes waiting on silver elite line for someone to pick up! help!
@americanair why would i even consider continuing your point program when i received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@americanair we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
@americanair thanks for getting back to me. but i will find other airlines in the future.
@americanair why would i pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that are not even worth $200?
@americanair stranded for 24 hours in mia patrick casimir has been the only aa staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
@americanair no thanks. as i said being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid aa as possible.
@americanair sorry so late flight responded to your dm.
@americanair believe me i understand. flight #2955. was originally booked for sunday. flight was cancelled flighted and rescheduled for today.
@americanair aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit sunday. #nocareforcustomers

@americanair if i want to change my flight due to weather conditions in dallas this weekend i should be able to cover change fee with miles
@americanair are you expecting delays/cancelled flightlations at dallas on 25/26th due to the snow? nothing like monday i hope!
@americanair please explain why it costs almost the same price of a full roundtrip fair to only change the departure time of a flight?

@americanair oh it is nothing my issue was already resolved and i am in the air

@americanair i need refund.
@americanair really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans not animals. #americandairlinessucks
@americanair why is raleigh not on the updated southern states advisory???
@americanair hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found
@americanair and it is not a inconvenience it is a disaster. it is a $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
@americanair have your experts seen this? this is right at rdu airport. http://t.co/mplio6dygn
@americanair stop sending me back to customer relations i have hand written a letter to them send in a letter called them no help!!
@americanair is large wichita falls airport not receiving any arrivals? i have called and no one answers. i been waiting for 1 day

@americanair i guess that is your way of saying thanks for sharing but i cannot help you good luck. happy birthday to me. ugh
@americanair lots of upset people freezing terminal and no gate agent. kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length.
@americanair the pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of aa incompetence and poor equip checks.
@americanair fly my child
@americanair yes i am. 2495/1170. rno departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at dfw to lga. i can do the 1120am to los angeles and then to jfk
@americanair how are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the aa3490 delay/pending cancelled flightlation?
@americanair lost and found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #fail
@americanair oh they seem to have reappeared now laugh out loud
@americanair and then wanted to change it to ba for avios.
@americanair oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in mce. we only wanted the cx card on there to select the free seats
@americanair to announce during boarding that you chose to limit catering to the point that you will run out shows a lack of planning imo.
@americanair thanks for the quick response - it is appreciated!
@americanair guess that's what i get for bragging on you. i fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they do not have other options js
@americanair thanks for the update
@americanair thanks for finally letting me get through to book my flight. frustration set in... #donedeal #talktoahuman
@americanair i guess i was one of the select few that had not had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked
yes and it gets disconnected due to the lack of wifi strength “@americanair: @mauererpower have you reached out to @gogo for help david?”
@americanair the communications seems to be an issue too no?
@americanair hi guys.i have 2/25 rno-dfw tomorrow.plane coming from dfw with bad weather in am.should i consider fê-route as i have connect?
@americanair traveling with my infant: do you check the carseat for free? if so do you provide a bag? someone told me but wanted to confirm
@americanair now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???

@americanair lets hope it stays that way.big thanks to your ground/outside crews all across the us the last month. great fb post yesterday.
@americanair my boss is :)
@americanair sitting on plane in columbus supposed to leave an hour ago. now the mechanic cannot find a tool to service the shock absorber.
@americanair not here yet but i plan on it. if you could have them fly low and slow right in front of me that would be great. ;-)
@americanair forgot to select my ksml on my flight to la and it is a few minutes under the 24 hour mark. is there any way to change it?
@americanair i picked the nonstop flight bc i had things to get to. should’ve taken difference route or airline i suppose!
@americanair your response has been incredible. truly amazed at the steps you have taken to enhance your customer relations. big thank you 😄
@americanair i will direct message you.
@americanair yes talked to them. fll says is at central. central says is at fll and here we go again. i am betting this will go 6 mths
@americanair but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
@americanair is there lack of communication/competition between the american and the air by any chance?
@americanair i can direct message it to you if you follow me
@americanair no had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home.
@americanair 4285. apparently we’re told staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don’t.
@americanair over 70 days no contact from a human or apology letter. @americanair is #yucki. read all about it soon http://t.co/9r9omzqavi
@americanair well i am showing i am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed?

@americanair @cityandsand we're trying to coordinate an airport hand-off of nutella! #veryimportantproject
@americanair if the flight i selected online was what was ticketed i would not be missing my connection. i need help getting to dfw or iah!!
@americanair my seat is disgusting. old and dirty. when are you going to refurbish this plane? us air 597 jfk to phx
@americanair is there any way to manually add gift cards to an ex-eu ticket( aa metal on long haulba for intra-eu)?
@americanair i understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
@americanair once again flying aa4285 once again 60+ minute delay because of mechanical issues. perhaps you should consider maintenance?
@americanair no repair made to the water line. no potable water on board this flight. we will take off soon. time for new planes mci&gt;dfw.
@americanair thanks for the recommendation. we've been sitting here for 45 minutes last update was 35 minute ago.
@americanair i will be sticking with @southwest in the future. no change fees first bag free and stellar customer service.
@americanair does it show that we are on the same plane?
@americanair although you have no control of the weather you came through with a great customer service
@americanair there is no local agent! there is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible.
@americanair ...2/2 does not help me.
@americanair as i already have a booked flight that i cannot use &amp; cannot change w/o a $200 fee flight booking problems a different type of ticket...1/2
@americanair depends on the terminal what' the best option? arrive c depart a. breakfast burrito is what i am craving.. any update on 1119?
@americanair an overzealous stewardess prevented us from bringing in a car seat! #worstflight!
@americanair watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print
@americanair i wish i could remember all of their names!
@americanair and is there a delay on our connection to pns?
@americanair thanks for getting back to me. how frequently are these weather advisories updated throughout the day?
@americanair living in dfw.. your hub.. hate having to fly to jfk to get to ireland
@americanair ok. there is no one at the airport that is helping us. another customer got told the flight is not leaving till 1220
@americanair thank you aa this is how i always start my vacations http://t.co/dzkc3auzu9
@americanair how do i talk to an actual person that will help me and do what you guys should do?
@americanair customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating.
@americanair flight aa1119 cx to aa157. killing my layover still wanting breakfast. i am hungry! get me to dfw!
@americanair yes thank you. just not how i wanted to start my vacation!
@americanair my flight number is 3m 50
@americanair your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. we can not get any information about our flight.
@americanair when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft..
@americanair i know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
@americanair thank you for replying. trying to figure out how to get from there from dfw
@americanair do not merge with an airline that ain't ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #nothappy @usairways #needcoffee
@americanair @usairways yes obviously! it just stinks that 4pm is the one option when she was supposed to fly at 7am yesterday.
“@americanair: @dumas2ttg good morning tamara. we'll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.”#noxtralegroom #nocoatcloset
@americanair made it! thanks aa!
@americanair how do you not do maintenance on #md80 while it sits for two days? frozen lines found after its boarded? come on! #faail #mci
@americanair why thank you!! yayayay!!
@americanair that what i hoped - contacted them 3 weeks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in us funds. #frustrated
@americanair we're all being told by emergency services to stay home for the next 24-48 hours.
@americanair thank you for being so responsive on twitter. truly impressive.
@americanair flight ba1551 departing tomorrow (wednesday) - not cancelled flightled but how can anyone make it to the airport in this weather?
@americanair @usairways she's on manchester to charlotte fl 4628 told her she could get on a 4pm flight to west palm beach. nothing earlier?
@americanair @usairways #boo! wack ass terminal 6 @flylaxairport. no food. no lounge. no bueno!! never again!!!
@americanair it is flight 5348
@americanair you sent me a cheque today which can’t be paid into a uk bank account. very annoying!
@americanair the wichita falls airport is the worst will never fly in or out again. unknowledgeable staff.
@americanair please can you tell me why dfw has a weather advisory and rdu does not? the entire state of nc has shut down from ice &amp; snow!
thank you @americanair! much appreciated.
i would like the 11c i originally tried for @americanair - again happy to pay the difference
@americanair when will you be issuing a weather advisory for rdu?? the entire state of nc has shut down from the overnight winter storm.
@americanair i’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. is there someone i can speak to?
@americanair mission accomplished today thank you!
@americanair zoom in on the sauce and potatoes. this stuff is vile. and i mean vile. http://t.co/m2phoavrxc
@americanair when will the merging of miles between you and @usairways be complete? was not it this month?
@americanair - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. today. worst on the planet. and i have flown almost all of them
@americanair when will there be wifi on the dca-stl route? 2 hour flight could use some love!
@americanair what is that!? why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/ifespcbztm
@americanair thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. will never book again with your airline. train your flight attendants better.
@americanair i lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
@americanair thanks for the great customer service. family made it back to sat safely. the weather at dfw made things a little worrisome.
@americanair she seems a little preoccupied - that's why i am bringing it to your attention. i am just flagging an issue as an observer.
@americanair she was at gate on time though they made her cry and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. plane still outside.
@americanair disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. the agent asked her counterparts why this person was talking to her.
@americanair yes starting w/ flight 1278 getting me home more than 48 hours late flightr. record locator bsuxlu
@americanair your aa3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. she was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. sign still now boarding...
@americanair fantastic thanks! will try and tweet a photo of the view :)
@americanair excellent! love you guys! if it is first class i will hug ya'll! see you shortly!
@americanair thanks have emailed them. how long should i expect for a response?
@americanair they said it works 80-90% of the time dfw security entrance c26. before/after pre-check whereas i paid for the service.
@americanair 3659 from sgf -&gt; dfw. you might want to clear off the ice for the planes landing. 😳
@americanair great job tyr ground crew...now let us get this bird outta here!!! tell flight 3200 to wait on me...be there in 45 mikes!
@americanair @usairways stated before i am not getting any help there. tk over 8 hours yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site.
@americanair one question.. my wife did not get the bonus. should i call about it today?
@americanair but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it i guess. your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform.
@americanair good morning! wondering why my pre-tsa check was not on my boarding pass this morning??
@americanair yes i do bit you do not follow me so i cannot direct message you
@americanair as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
@americanair again no special meal catered for me in f jfk-lax. thankfully i am on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd not cater on that
@americanair @superyan i did not get any compensation after cancelled flighting my departure twice and made me missed my own wedding.
@americanair 140 characters are not enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are
@americanair was hoping for 8a if possible for some frozen views along the way!
@americanair ...have you seen blue? go look it up :)
@americanair your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. i will be choosing another airline next time.
@americanair really? that's it? not even a we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time
@americanair delayed: aa3186 - missed due to delay: aa3186 - new flight now delayed: aa2401
@americanair thank you.
@americanair she told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. really? do not have time to do that. #terrible
@americanair hi when will your next set of flights be out for next year from dublin???
@americanair. had my flight changed from us airways to you now i cannot get two seats together. can you help?
@americanair the flight is the wrong day. confirm # usxlon. departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people
@americanair having trouble flight booking problems a seat on us84 11 march operated by aa. neither airline's website will allow seat selection?
@americanair thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance.
@americanair i fly weekly with you and have not seen one
@americanair i would love to say the same but it is not so much. 5hs flight no internet no personal a/c 20yr old plane. #nofunatall
@americanair uwon't allow me2make changes online force me2sit through excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. thats service?
@americanair oh i will aa on speed dial
thanks @chasefoster. was just about to book a flight to uk using @americanair but after reading this exchange there's no way. i have sent
@americanair amazing to watch @chasefoster (who travels with celebs all over the world) show the youth of america who *not* to fly with.
@americanair travel week delays cancelled flightlations if you want to learn more about the merger press 1 delay my connector in chicago #deice
@americanair requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
@americanair horrible service @loganairports. luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. did not help at all.
@americanair that’s a rather clunky process. whoever designed that clearly doesn’t understand e-mail 101.
@americanair thanks! flight 2160 today. great crew!
@americanair thank you for contacting american. the email address you have written to is an unmonitored account”
@americanair your customer relations department has one-way e-mail. how is not allowing responses helpful?
@americanair if you are sorry answer my claims (aa ref#1-2990176298 1-3001885409 and : 1-3001885409) accordingly without using weather
@americanair the motor that usually starts the engine is broke and @cvgairport ground crew failed to do it on time per pilot #maintenance
@americanair is rising like the sun at dca this morning. @natca members have the best view. #avgeek http://t.co/vahdekvoke
@americanair she has the guy you served drinks 2 til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women
@americanair and @cvgairport get it together perfect combination for delays and cancelled flightlations
@americanair sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! no more aa in my future !
@americanair thank you for the info! changes need to be made over the phone correct? is there any way an aa agent can call me directly?
@americanair are you a bot? haha always same lies from you!
@americanair especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...thanks
@americanair fortunately the window seat was a no-show. able to scoot over and create space.
@americanair so great aa1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what?
@americanair this has to be the absolute worst experience ever!
@americanair so i have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. this has to be the biggest bunch of bull!
@americanair just need to know why it was not done like it was promised it would yesterday
@americanair too late flight now. boarded exit rows taken. could not have gotten worse. guy next 2 me should've bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning
@americanair did that yesterday. on the phone with them now
@americanair re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you.
@americanair @usairways statement was not sent yesterday like jeanine said. after i even called last night as well. again excellent service
@americanair @usairways so who do i need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so i can get the credit for the charges?
@americanair 3 months of straight travel ahead. time to find new airline.
@americanair that's what is on my ticket and my confirmation email. anything else?
@americanair i am flying into dca my bag is at iad. i am already late flight for my meetings at work. i will call the number when i land 😭
@americanair try this. dpdfpp
@americanair face palm!!! cannot believe the last 24 hours 1.5 hours of sleep and no and no and what you cannot do......
@americanair just wow regina just told me i cannot file or request a lost bag statement until i finish my travel. so until i get to dc argg
@americanair i shared my experience several times (aa ref#1-2990176298) but aa's response is senseless weather was not the cause!!!
@americanair record number is bpdfpp.
@americanair you should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite condescending platitudes....
@americanair is non existent and i will take this as far as needed.why hide behind a corporate logo? provide a number #tcf #useless #amateur
@americanair lax-ogg-lax using hard earned miles and was given lousy service faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. your customer care
@americanair they were no where to be found at midnight last night! i would think the agent in los angeles could have relayed that info.bag on flt
@americanair you cancelled flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. not acceptable. upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy
@americanair is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? flights from...
@americanair it is not good enough. you need to provide a phone number. other partners do. should be investigated by @iata @thefaaonline
laugh out loud great answer.. “@americanair: @jayfranceschi our agents are checking in passengers as quickly as possible. we appreciate your patience.”
@americanair psalms i was right.
@americanair yes it is in dulles and i need it delivered to the embassy suites in herndon va. i am still in chicago from the fiasco in los angeles
@americanair what's the point? so i can wait for another 6 weeks. you are one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
@americanair machines are broken lines are out the door for self service cust. support and bag check in.
@americanair would have been had i seen this before 1130pm est when i was sound asleep.
@americanair merged airlines do not work for ff programs. very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #attitudeissues
@americanair you do not have those abilities anywhere! not at the ticket counter at cust service or online. that's why we're done here.
@americanair when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think aa would want to earn your business but guess not?
@americanair needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. people need to catch their flights! http://t.co/4mqfmxebxt
@americanair i know your policy. just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances.
@americanair the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing. just wow
@americanair oh no she left the counter and went downstairs. then she told elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter.
@americanair of course you are because that's your companies job! you guys failed at it in the first place. upgrade me and then we'll talk.
@americanair @delta maybe? long trip late flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals no good. i thought i paid for it 50$ instead.
@americanair you really need some customer service training for your unhappy ees in the morning in chicago. gate k20 at 430 chking her schd
.@americanair (2/3) ...i sat on the runway for 4 more hours b4 takeoff (10 hours late flight 4:30 am). pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue.
@americanair flight 1679 (n76200) prepares for flight at @flytpa before departing for @fly2ohare http://t.co/xbkvcraokn
.@americanair alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago i sat on a plane at jfk for 3 hours deplaned for 3 more and when i re-boarded...
@americanair i am trying to choose my seats but every time i go to the next flight i get system error
@americanair thanks both airlines said that it is located at aa detroit. also was informed that it flew with aa which should not matter.
@americanair we did talk with delta for about hour over phone and i got a number from delta that they asked to give to aa which i did.
@americanair policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation. flying is not for... http://t.co/dqnn0rf1v8
@americanair already did- reply was sorry. we believe this to be fair. as a journalist writing an article on my trip i will include this
@americanair leave us stranded send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling.
@americanair i have been trying to change a thursday flight and there's a ridiculous wait time on the phone and your website is not helping
@americanair @slacksoft_uk i saw an american 767 in old colours at @heathrowairport on saturday! was surprised to see!
@americanair we all did! skipper's walk-around too :(
@americanair plane veers off runway at icy dallas airport http://t.co/dw6vdvqxbb
@americanair thank you for the acknowledgement. the ife did not work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system.
@americanair thanks for the canned reply.
@americanair just went to check into flight 24 hr advance again husband and i are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen??
@americanair no; i just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
@americanair or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was cancelled flightled!
@americanair i tried when i landed but there was no-one there. i have emailed your customer service twice now who do not seem to care.
@americanair no i have since rebooked with another airline what i would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!
@americanair nothing you have done enough.
@americanair i was rebooked on a flight that was too late flight for my connection!
@americanair such a suprise! new vanity kit set for frequent travellers 😀 thank you aa! http://t.co/fa7nygn1ux
@americanair gah this is so frustrating! nobody has my address here in the usa. where are my bags!?!? so disorganised!!!!!!!!!!!
@americanair lovely flight back from mia to lhr - great crew - thanks :-))
@americanair i have emailed several times.hand wrote a letterwent to airportcalled.please fix this! or @abc7newsbayarea please help!
@americanair offered me a cot to sleep on?after they cancelled flightled my flight. a fucking cot. what about a hotel like you're supposed to provide
@americanair over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or cancelled flightled. i am done with you.
@americanair another generic response guys? cmon. you're terrible. how about an actual helpful person? not all the rude employees at los angeles
@americanair i tried extremely rude. even the supervisor. and when i asked to speak to his supervisor i was told no
@americanair yes but you are still human i hope dealing with all the horror stories people share... i complained to dot. everyone should
@americanair try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere
@americanair i have filed multiple complaints. i prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp.
@americanair worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
@americanair terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer
@americanair worst service ever!! delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! and your employees are rude 😡😡
@americanair thanks for the generic computer generated response. how about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry
@americanair they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible..
@americanair i did twice.got a letter back saying that your company does not issue refunds for phone bills help!phone will be shut off
@americanair oh yeah. i guess those are two different things. 3 am does weird things to my brain. thanks again! xox
@americanair yes. no one is answering and i am on a train
@americanair ty! but their site says please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for american way. ...
@americanair its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them
@americanair just hoping/praying for a safe flight. they've had to stop and de-ice our plane yet again😞
@americanair after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 toarrange pick upin argentinaclaiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. help!
@americanair pity that a machine replied or perhaps my story not unusual. expected better response given article in in-flight magazine.
@americanair i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. my questions is why do some people get hotel and the others do not like myself?
@americanair i responded. your information different than your customer service line
@americanair done
@americanair will not help us on the phone at the gate or in checkin. i book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service
@americanair no no no you direct message me i pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? how about the other way around
@americanair i had a 6am flight i can get no rest because i have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
@americanair does not know the meaning of customer service. nightmare. paid for direct flight. bumped to dallas. flight cancelled flighted. terrible
@americanair that's absolutely horrible customer service. the person supposed to call me cannot immediately call back when disconnected???
@americanair will do. i also passed the website around to other passengers.
@americanair my flight was cancelled flightled i called they said they'd call back in 1:36. they did and hung up now saying i have to wait 2 hrs!!
@americanair *does = does not
@americanair okay... if someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. it is a very small item.
@americanair what kind if airlines do you guys run? the people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? terrible customer service!
@americanair @emxlyy the wheel was broken when we got it. we swear.
@americanair cancelled flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for los angeles now flight cancelled flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available???

@americanair hey! i have a name issue on my reservation can you help?
@americanair i direct messaged you
@americanair thank you! my lost item was located at ordinance and is being returned to me.
why does not @americanair provide a means for dialogue? what is the fear that drives this decision? #worstcustomerserviceever
@americanair 2284 four hours late flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad i missed my event
@americanair please allow me to speak with someone. a dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
@americanair it is not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when i called. i was hung up on. and it is my daughters bag
@americanair if sna curfew causes diversion do you provide transportation from lax? on aa1237 now pilot not sure if we have time.
why does not @americanair allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service? #worstcustomerserviceever
@americanair it is not cool that my flight was cancelled flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. 👎😡✈️ #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm
@americanair no you should do something about everything happened yesterday...

@americanair - reference number to this request: 1-3001408092
@americanair just curious. thanks for the response as always good or bad. better than your competition.
@americanair your customer service is deplorable. i am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
@americanair were stuck on a plane in dallas that's supposed to be going to okc. there's an issue w/ the plane. any idea on how much longer?
@americanair - thanks. she submitted a damaged bag complaint online...is there anything else we can do? #goodcustomerservice
@americanair thanks!
@americanair they responded. i cannot respond to their response. nor can i speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
@americanair thanks you always be my airline of choice when possible
@americanair gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain
@americanair who do i report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight?
.@americanair how about connecting me with a customer service rep? i would rather speak to a person than a computer. thanks!
@americanair tsa. when i tried to check in the things i have bought your people told me it was late flight to do it. so... i want my things back
@americanair arrived +-10pm eastern. had to deplane on the crjs airstairs to an icy tarmac. valet bags sent to carousel so it was 10:20pm.

@americanair by the way you guys should consider making a lounge at austin intl. airport! very populate flightd area! will help the company for sure👌
@djevolutionhd as an ep who travels 125k+ miles a year with @americanair i would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience
@americanair are you expecting any delays out of #dfw tomorrow morning?
@americanair that was the worst customer service experience ever. too bad for you i am a lawyer. enjoy my wrath.
@americanair it is beyond complicated now and it feels like when i used to fly with united. platinum means nothing.
@americanair i look forward to hearing back and hope that my next trip will not be like this
@americanair oh trust me. i am in love. it is so beautiful!
@americanair followed! sure hope you can help!

@americanair glad that you wanted to help me but you didn't. have an agent call me before i rant about shitty service every day
@americanair there are only 24 hours to cancelled flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. impossible scenario
@americanair there are no more flights via united when i arrive to dfw and my car is parked at iah 😁
@americanair your online site does not have flights listed in chronological order resulting in a mis-purchase. anything that can be done?
@americanair i found my footage!! :d i am so so happy.

@americanair you've got to be kidding. look at the pictures. i am hoping it is on the flight that just came in. the whole story is 2 much
@americanair you're clueless. a kind rez agnt contacted usair 4me around midnite told them what to do. if not that i would have missed funeral.

@americanair do you have hand sanitizer in the bathrooms on your flights?

@americanair nope. could not make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep the 24 hour window has closed.
@americanair does not care about customers break your gear and tell you they cannot do anything. @wsj @latimes @chicagotribune #media #filmcrew
@americanair yes....twice...for two different flights and occasions
@americanair why is your cover photo of twa? just wondering.

@americanair i loved todays fight. but there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm
keep it up :) @americanair
@americanair @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
@americanair thanks for the apology. a commitment to fix your broken system would be better. actually fixing it would be better still.
@americanair seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. aa knew age of child.
@americanair this is the biggest joke i have ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
@americanair pay for my accommodations when you are the ones cancelled flightling it for no reason and i know your saying (lying) it cause of weather
@americanair airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have i heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
@americanair this is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
@americanair your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
@americanair cancelled flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was cancelled flight
@americanair again you guys are a huge joke and cancelled flight your flight for no reason. this is the third time in one trip for me that you have
@americanair what is going on? this is pathetic. online does not work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
@americanair i have just received the ticket. thank you for your help
@americanair this is getting out of hand. i called reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
@americanair on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane now the lines are frozen.
@americanair so disappointed with this airline never again will i book with you guys
@americanair thanks
@americanair you found my lost luggage won't bring it to me until tomorrow. next day if the weather is not nicer. terrible service
@americanair would it be okay to send you a direct message asking a few questions because i am deaf and been on hold so long?
@americanair sorry you were disappointed #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs
@americanair @nrosenb1 it is not allowing me to book available seats
@americanair seriously all flights from detroit to dallas are cancelled flightled 2 days in a row. i want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids.
@americanair of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. never ever ever again. #neveragain #aafail
@americanair literally just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to dr. appointment. wow
@americanair we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
@americanair i had an advantage # and you deactivated it. i do not think you should deactivate a customers account without their knowledge #help
@americanair thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
@americanair if it is in my backpack why do i need to see agent?
@americanair i really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
@americanair she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened your response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
@americanair hi aa ! i placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.just logged into my acct..its gone! seat has not been released to inv. help?
@americanair tpa - ord!!! aa1679 another successful journey thanks for the hospitality!
@americanair thank you for the response. much appreciated!
@americanair 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes. awful boarding process. hour and a half late flight
@americanair is there another line i can call when i am on hold for 5 hours? also how can i get compensated for this loss of time and money?
@americanair @rizzilient after days i finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! this is beyond ridicules. help!
@americanair asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. rep was rude. just told me no. did not even try to help!
@americanair any idea why flight 5392 from hsv to dfw tomorrow cancelled flightled about 45 minutes ago?
@americanair thanks. i actually made it my connection flight was delayed. guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/xggcntco8m
@americanair the issue was not a long wait. it was an infinite do loop. your system did not let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
@americanair did the policy change? i have seen people with hamsters and rabbits before.
@americanair thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held. ran with kids and flight departed. poor service at miami
@americanair an hour now waiting on the phone for us air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. love the service guys.
@americanair i am here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags for over an hour at dfw. the gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
@americanair right so i missed my connection / had a three hour kay over / then you lost my bag.
@americanair obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. no hotel no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry
@americanair i was suppose to be in fl 4 hours ago. and i am not. i have been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
@americanair my 2498 to clt left the gate. what is next for clt. need help
@americanair you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? interesting
@americanair still on hold. after you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/imrlau77ih
@americanair if it i have not rebooked did not get notified that it was cancelled flightled
@americanair is that the flight for tomorrow?
“@americanair: @thecandacesmith thanks for the shout-out candace! enjoy the ride.” always! i adore american airlines!
without notifying though? “@americanair: @krescate we do not like cancelled flightling flights kim but weather has not played nice with us.
still thinking those pjs may have me sold @americanair @momsgoodeats we'd #love to have you on board with us! @mandarinjourney here i come
@americanair do you have any flights with lie flat seating from stl to pdx around the date of march 5?
@americanair how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
@americanair customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
@americanair im still on hold...
@americanair you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? it is because your airline sucks.
@americanair are you people cruel or just stupid? why are you posting my personal email on the damn internet? have you lost your mind?!
@americanair do we get a class discount on your wifi? i will be flying your airlines at approx. 4 am?
@americanair #customerservice. sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. no excuses for this. tough to be loyal.
@americanair @contactcej thanks!
@americanair @americanairlines #bqonpa flight #1641 delayed from pos-mia missed #2214 mia- atl need seat on last flight to atl.
@americanair so bad service in miami airport..
@americanair needs an entire customer service overhaul @delta would never treat its customers with anything less that a1 service
@americanair are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
@americanair why do you continually play the according to federal regulations every 58 seconds. i could see if you had quicker service...
@americanair can i send you my trusted traveler id to add to my reservation for tsa pre?
@americanair thanks but i had to hire a car in chicago and drive to mke. does that mean i have to go to the airport?????
@americanair the folks at the executive platinum desk are great pros. they understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to sw.
@americanair he thanks you. anything you can do to help. would any further information help in the process?
@americanair thanks for a cancelled flightled flight then a delayed flight and not telling us more missed work more $ on hotel #worstcustomerservice
@americanair flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? i spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an ep agent on the phone now this?
.@americanair advised gas and pilot of my flight. too bad no one took action.
@americanair @usairways need to be reported to the @bbb_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #donotflywiththem
@americanair anything in particular i should ask for. will they want me to document my mileage plus status!
@americanair how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
@americanair i have been checking consistently and called multiple times. as a loyal aa customer i am disappointed.
@americanair congrats on your call center customer service! a guy named fidencio answered and he went above &amp; beyond to help me! 👌👌👌
@americanair daughter record loc. is kybilc. she is traveling with 3 y.o. and needs to be in adjacent seats not across isle.
@americanair gabriela in miami is a very rude employee.working the mia-lga check in. she made experience unpleasant. #customerexperience
@americanair okay makes no sense tho since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.
@americanair i did not want to cancelled flight i wanted to take someone off and keep my price. held at 402 at 10am today 440 now 530
@americanair it is not about the delay. it is about the communication.
@americanair would you like any additional details of my issue? airport flight agent name? or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?
@americanair 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central. about ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.
@americanair @maryella_green despite the inconvenience the situation was handled quickly and we appreciate it very much!
@americanair absolutely!
@americanair - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted
@americanair @usairways - i am pregnant with twins and you're going to abandon me overnight in an airport? no hotel? when it is your fault?
@americanair has no idea what they're doing. delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another to the same destination @ the same time.
@americanair @maryella_green just received it actually. thank you!!!!!!!!!

@americanair yepfiled a claim at heathrow yesterday. we were promised a call this morning with an update but got nothing.
@americanair why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 minute after deplane
@americanair you flew me into chi instead and i got a ride to mke. you said my bags would go to mke today. is it on the cancelled flightled flight tho?

@americanair so what should he do next exactly?!
@americanair flight for tomorrow was cancelled flightled. new one booked. seats taken care of. just a tweet to commend you all on the service. thanks!
@americanair instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
@americanair he is at the boston airport. there is a problem. the agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
@americanair see photo of b787 scale model &amp; our pn 320008a wheel deflator specified in chapter 32 of b787 amm. http://t.co/kfd4wqrklw

@americanair from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day

@americanair i do not believe it is acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. apparently that's standard.
@americanair i need to complain to aa but the email form field does not allow enough characters for my complaint. have a real email address?
@americanair our flight aa 1338 is delayed out of providenciales and will be missing our connection aa 1651 in miami to sea. who do we call?
@americanair here is the ticket they gave me after lying raising their voice. with no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cfhtk60r
@americanair we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
@americanair attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. is not the experience i thought i would have. terrible! http://t.co/5sdlyn9mss
@americanair i had booked online but unable to cancelled flight online. but finally got thru.
@americanair hey becky piela at the orange county airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
@americanair on feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me i would be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
@americanair this entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left. #customerservice
@americanair our flight attendant announced that we have transportation waiting for us for that flight so i think we'll make it.
@americanair been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hours now. anyone home?? or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cehroeurc5
@americanair we do not mind the fee! we were told we cannot change name on ticket at all.
@americanair thank you!!!! i will be there to pick her up on time.
@americanair the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish and does not reflect the use of a voucher
@americanair so whats the hold up on flight 4302?
@americanair well you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. bar none the best sm team in the airline industry in my opinion.
@americanair least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket i had to buy since you were not able to accommodate. thank you.
@americanair after being patient about my delayed bags for 5 weeks i was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. unacceptable!
@americanair i had to purchase a ticket that i never would have had to buy had the flight not been cancelled flightled. terrible customer service.
@americanair flt 703 sorry scheduled at 545 phl-mia a totally chaotic poorly addressed event. sent to three gates in the night
@americanair was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
@americanair not okay. since you could not put me on an earlier flight i had to buy my own ticket on another airline.
@americanair heard back at 7:30 am today was put on flight tomorrow am arriving home at 4 pm. meaning i would have to take a second day off work.
@americanair been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch!
@americanair considering it was past midnight i hung up and called again to receive another service call.
@americanair can i redeem aadavantage miles on lan flights?
@americanair i have tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 est. i am having no luck -help!
@americanair was put on hold for 5.5 hours then got a call back at 11:20 pm only to wait on hold for another hour.
@americanair you lost a customer today. flight today was cancelled flightled and i had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
@americanair just called regarding my bag came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice
@americanair to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
@americanair thanks
@americanair unacceptable. it is clear losing just one customer does not matter to american but how many more bankruptcies will it take
@americanair will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
@americanair is there a probability that flight 1330 from dfw to dtw will be delayed or cancelled flighted?

@americanair you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume however you never make acpt
@americanair but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights then was told she couldn't.
@americanair hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4kbtzvju3b
@americanair well you spelled my name wrong.
@americanair 2 hours now! no i am not patient. why do not you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone not tweet #onhold
@americanair please do something about boarding at dca 35x. many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. disorganized mess.
@americanair no standby line update online or on app either is troubling
@americanair no. had to cancelled flight my trip. instead of a $25 future trip voucher a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #wakinginmemphis
@americanair thanks just sent the direct message
@americanair unbelievable that i cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! the system simply hangs up!
@americanair thanks to your airline i now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.

@americanair way to suck at customer service dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you did not cancelled flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day.
@americanair umm unexpected?? unexpected meaning you guys did not know you had a major staff shortage ??

@americanair that's not the point. say its $1300 at the counter when i clearly see $500 on your site? aa agent was @ a loss 4 words too

@americanair no it is not - sheer incompetence was reigning at dfw today. i was there. on a plane on the good runway. i doubt you were.
@americanair yes we did make it home. but by no means am i happy. i have always chosen aa as my first choice when flying i am rethinking that...
@americanair still waiting on a direct message response..... #sloooowresponses
@americanair @robinreda that can be a stop over before paris. you are an embarrassment
@americanair @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. i am positive you can find a plane to europe

@americanair @nashinmypants lmao this is so funny
@americanair have been waiting over three hours to talk to someone to rebook a flight due to weather. does call back service actually work??
@americanair the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. that is what's most frustrating
@americanair i was on a flight for tomorrow and my reservation is coming up. help me!
@americanair please direct message me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. i am platinum aa and considering quitting aa bc of this.
@americanair thanks for following up. i think it is fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars i had to buy.
@americanair it was my friend. she should not have been scheduled so close together at los angeles then not reimbursed. it is costing her 12 hours &amp;$250
@americanair understood. thanks anyway
@americanair so what are you going to do for me since i cannot take the option you gave me. what type of refund will you do for me?

@americanair all good! i am catching the 11:10p flight tonight. thanks for the response.
@americanair that's interesting-agent told me so. sadly another booked passenger did not make it to gate by push back so i made it on.
@americanair flight cancelled flightled website refers to 1-800# the 1-800# hangs up on me. not auto-rebooked. really? horrible company.
@americanair booked aa3370 departing jfk 2/25/15. it was booked via ba and i want to change my ff# to aa can you do that for me via twitter?
@americanair we have been sitting on this bird #aa1457 for 2 hours on the dfw tarmac. some water would be nice. where's your manners?
@americanair been calling your for 4+ hours to reschedule a flight to #dfw due to weather and your won't even let me stay on hold.....

@americanair i am still on hold if you're wondering... 4 hours 37 minutes and counting. #servicefail #onholdforever #suboptimal
@americanair i have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel dfw b16 gate agent needs training or new job
@americanair @nrosenb1 it says changes cannot be made online
@americanair what's the status of flights for tuesday out of dallas??
@americanair hey you cancelled flightled my flight and i cannot get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). can i get some service?
@americanair our ft 1261 tus/dfw (w/cx to lga) tomorrow cancelled flighted 4 hours so far waiting for call back. what should we do? need to get to new york city
@americanair @usairways and our meals are also on us because this company does not care about their #customers. truly disgraceful.
@americanair by far the best example of the worst company @cowboycerrone
@americanair @usairways cost me a day of vacation ($350 hotel stay) day of dog boarding and a day of airport parking.
@americanair got my bags this morning! thanks!
@americanair joanna is wonderful new flight booked by a very friendly and helpful agent during a very stressful day! thank you!
@americanair @usairways and the way i have been spoken to by #dfw and #mia employees is truly disgusting. save the pain fly with anyone else
@americanair i am home &amp; only 9hr late flight. no thanks to your service centre - their plan involved 4 flight legs all across na and 2 full days..
@americanair thanks for losing my bag. how hard is it to care for a bag w priority on it?why do you cont to not care for ep's?

@americanair thank you for the response. when i book i have tried my aa number and my us airways number and each time it does not pick it up
@americanair to my destination. after waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. our #luggage made the flight though...
@americanair flights out of dallas on tuesday are not going to be cancelled flightled correct?
@americanair that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscar😄💝💝💝
@americanair cost me 1 day of #vacation ($350) and all i got was a rude woman tell me to go to another country and figure out how to get...
@americanair you should really help @cowboycerrone out you are getting a ton of bad publicity right now #willneverflywithyou
@americanair flight number #2386
@americanair it looks like a mistake
@americanair lost @lesliewolfson luggage on flight yesterday morning #miami to #newyork #lga no response and no luggage more than 37 hours ltr

@americanair wow @americanair still screw n stuff up
@americanair i just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? no explanations why. no answer on the 800 number.
@americanair employees are racist!!!!!
@americanair this is pathetic customer service. why have bag tags barcodes and computers if your response is not yet located?
@americanair i hope it takes you 6 hours to get home when it should take 20. my flight was cancelled flightled because they could not staff the plane

@americanair @duanenclark ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? does anyone have any business sense at aa?
@americanair why do i have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
@americanair due to gate agents i missed my connecting flight to mexico city...not a happy customer aa- let us correct this
@americanair she does not have twitter.
@americanair at some point you need to tell passengers what is going on. at jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
@americanair its not that it is the rude agent who would not listen to anything i would say and it clearly fit into the sizer
@americanair seriously i do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when i have to prepare for a family funeral.
@americanair your gate agents at dfw gate b16 are pathetic tonight. terrible communication stories changing and apathetic
@americanair i was worried when my bag went san to dca 24 hours before me. but our reunion was an organized breeze! http://t.co/uoaryq98pu
@americanair yea no worries. i am just going home to denver. not your fault weather sucks bad.

@americanair what is the status of flight 1675 tomorrow
@americanair 4828 but i just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now i have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. so thanks.
@americanair the pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. neither happened.
@americanair my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
@americanair hey so i am very disappointed with my time traveling with you! i have had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
@americanair 37 minutes??????
@americanair having trouble getting rebooked
@americanair i understand. i am feeling cranky. i called aa's bag tracker number and heard your bag has not been located. 😩
@americanair aa45 ... jfk to las.
@americanair i am willing to hold for an agent. you are not being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
@americanair i have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my cancelled flightled flight what i can do?
@americanair need to go frm tpa to mci tmrw &amp; my connection through dfw is cancelled flightled. can you connect me through a difference city? been on hold for 2 hours

@americanair no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? wtw / grounds crew is here / hope you're ready to cover my delay
@americanair you cannot even get someone on the phone. great story for the media.
“@americanair: jason you'll end up missing your connection. please see our dfw agents for assistance.” nope! has not taken off yet still!
@americanair finally made it to chicago - 13 hours late flight. did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. never again. good bye.
@americanair instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
@americanair guys 5350 in dfw stuck at the gate for half an hour. do we pull the slide or what?
@americanair plz kys i have been sitting in this plane for an hour i want to leave
@americanair after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
@americanair now you've cancelled flightled my flight. first a priority ticket bumped and now this. you're losing customers. people are furious.
@americanair i finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
@americanair it that you say is going to help us? give me a number to call that is not a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
@americanair ok. pilots are looking for agents - they jumped out / flt 5350 #dfw / this is crazy
@americanair no you're not you're trying to book me past when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day i am trying 2 travel
@americanair because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to cincinnati even though we can't. who exactly is
@americanair you all should really be ashamed. the entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
@americanair you could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. we're stranded in dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
@americanair just cancelled flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today then booked one in 2 days and no customer service
@americanair thanks - i note some but not all flights are cancelled flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of dfw today/tomorrow?
@americanair we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
@americanair we tried. we are headed to a funeral in cincinnati and your people did not even tell us we could get on standby.
@americanair they do not even give an option to hold.. just say lines are busy plz try late flightr
@americanair i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. i have never experienced such awful cs ever
@americanair the delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying what's the hury the plane is not leaving
@americanair delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 mia-cur. how can i see if they made it onto the flight?
@americanair would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was aa's fault
@americanair your logo looks like 3d glasses.
@americanair no private message me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
@americanair and let flt 2350 know i am coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off flt 5350 #dfw
@americanair you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. this has been one of the worst experiences.
@americanair @expedia are killing me. over 3 hours to get no human to help me.
@americanair 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
@americanair yeah rebooked for tomorrow morning. but extremely disappointed to miss a wedding.

@americanair hats off to admiral lounge attendant @ yyz terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none available elsewhere.
@americanair we'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight is ridiculous.
@americanair thanks. bummer. poor planning on my part. i assume the card in passbook won't work either?
@americanair you should be more timely with bags that missed a flight people need their undies the next morning!
@americanair i tried that. they won't book us with another airline. i wish i had flown with you! we are now stuck in fl til weds.
@americanair a true #americanview ...the national mall http://t.co/n7exdbcrhg
@vanessaannz seriously you hate @americanair since they cannot accommodate you due to inclemental weather disruptions? laugh out loud very funny
@americanair gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures. i rushed back to terminal c for 8:25 flight but they have not strtd boarding.
@americanair i know you are getting pummeled tonight @dfwairport we were one of the lucky out of @slcairport just one more @austinairport

@americanair won't answer the reservation line! nice service. we may be stuck...
@americanair it is not your agents; it is your voice activated system that's not working right. and no email on cancelled flightlation. lots of problems
@americanair i was on flt 2222 tomorrow they moved me to 750. i need it moved to tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks

@americanair i am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and do not see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines

@americanair none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mf7rabgn8a every last leg back to us says invalid
@americanair i am booked for tuesday night. 60 degrees in alabama right now. i am good. stay warm and safe.
@americanair so plot thickens. we're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. apparently under the weather in large numbers....
@americanair 800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. very frustrating. cannot talk to humans.
@americanair what happened?? we did not get a notification about a departure cancelled flightation tomorrow. why will it take 2 hours to talk to someone
@americanair you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #aaalwayslate flight
@americanair @derekc21 to my surprise ba does not have me registered in the system i was getting hopeful :( lets step it up okay ?

@americanair it should not happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. what steps do you take to protect customers if their items
@americanair american airlines.
@americanair all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. these issues are based on negligence.
@americanair the worst air experience i have ever had and i am not in the first plane yet.
@americanair i just dmed you
@americanair why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
@americanair @dai_president good luck at dfw this evening aa!
@americanair so we have a cancelled flightled flight in about twelve hours. maybe we'll have heard from an aa rep at that point.
@americanair on hold for 3 hours...got an agent immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 minute 80 minute late flightr waiting
@americanair awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. they snuck my wife a warm cookie. thx!
@americanair flight attendants on aa2402 were spectacular.fed the entire cabin then food from coach. why do you keep serving this vile food
@americanair @cinedrones i just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point let alone be courteous or helpful 😳

@americanair approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at dfw on #americanairlines flight 3056 - oscar performance
@americanair - we have; they were useless. baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. now maybe midnight.
@americanair checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
@americanair makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. they keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
@americanair aa 2258 why have you cancelled flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives? very poor.
@americanair how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were over an hour delayed? #flight293
@americanair i spent $600 on my flight. could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
@americanair plz bring more agents up to dfw aa cstmr srvc ctr gates a there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/ucveu2hurz
@americanair the food served on aa2402 was vile and gross.the entire cabin did not eat their meal. survey the flight crew. another gross out
@americanair the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #flight293
@americanair never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
@americanair looks like i have. best i can hope for i guess. it is on us air so i do not think i will get miles on alaska. which sucks.

@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you’ve inconvenienced #cancelled flightledflight
@americanair also the problem is not calling us at all. other airlines send an automatic call and email and they rebook as a courtesy.

@americanair thanks to fa shawn for spectacular service on flt 79 lhrdfw and to fa susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
@americanair i cannot choose a seat online because i booked on @priceline ??? #smh
@americanair it was not really about the delay. it was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot. makes a person paranoid.
@americanair overweight flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. we all know that. let us call it what it is.
@americanair @jaynegelman howabout more@blacklist too!!
@americanair at jfk flight to boston delayed 20 minute waiting for catering they are boarding flight to los angeles waiting for over and hour wtf?
@americanair yes it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. also i never got an email from aa saying my flight was cancelled flightled.
@americanair can you help with my cancelled flightled flight -- i would like to book another flight...i've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
@americanair i ended up on a flight to la my fourth time on standby. thanks! http://t.co/na5g5eakpa

@americanair thanks. now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. won't be here till late flight tomorrow morning.
@americanair that's okay thanks for letting me know. appreciate all the responses.
@americanair spoke too soon. 30 minute late flightr still waiting for bags to load. some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
@americanair @heymynameissean sean if you look at the aa schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. they are gr8
@americanair thanks for the show! 👍
@americanair well done you have taken the fun out of air travel @phlairport
@americanair no worries even though i was talking about seat assignment :)
@americanair @kconti44 this looks like jfk - had a great pic of the oneworld jets lined up on the opposite side #air berlin lan and aa.
@americanair been trying to call all day get hung up on every time. your guys are horrible!
@americanair @jameswester see james we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits
@americanair @superyan i did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when i was at jfk a few hours ago. good luck w/flights!
@americanair sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer system issue at what point do you cancelled flight a flight? ridiculous @phlairport
@americanair @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. stop understaffing!
@americanair yo could that be a catering truck before mine eyes? unmoving? http://t.co/asw6qwuf1z
@americanair @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. but they cannot staff a call center
@americanair great seats on this aircraft!
is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @americanair ? been waiting 28hrs and still have not even seen one plane😡
@americanair both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvsltqzkmq
@americanair aa919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. surreal!
@americanair 901 #miami to #rio to participate at @rcm_oficial representing @cisnerosmedia #yourstoryhere
@americanair a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! really?! come on!
@americanair @cyncyn661 are you now flying 763s to madrid from jfk or is this dfw/ord? huge !!
@americanair the wine served in usairways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
@americanair who's your pick for best picture? i do not want to board your airline until i know
@americanair we have 3 more passengers with me there are two more reservation numbers
@americanair @patrichruben no profit maximization is your top priority. nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs
@americanair 8:30 departure? sure. is there a catering strike at jfk? @foxnews @cnbc @bloombergradio http://t.co/hpgxyzrw8o
@americanair @derekc21 so what would be a file number that works needs to be 10 characters email me derek.austin@century21.ca easier
@americanair @manuel_c here for you as in yeah we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our twitter bot cares? or....
@americanair #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
@americanair you have the worst customer service of any airlines i have ever encountered. flat out awful
@americanair @ezemanalyst why do not you tweet canned impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got
@americanair done!! thank you so much!!
@americanair nice aa employee making skillful excuses about late flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/ypvpvdltys
@americanair then taxi across dfw airport for 20 minute to then state 75 minute past departing from gate that we need deiced? wow. uncool &amp; untrue
@americanair 24 hours &amp; 2 cncld flights late flightr i have landed in phl. now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. please do better than this.
@americanair delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hours on hold yesterday &gt;1 hr today. still no bag. #aa http://t.co/qkkjdfobos
@americanair yeah try harder. no catering truck in sight. can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?
@americanair this is awful customer service.
@americanair everything's good now brothaaaaaa
@americanair its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
@americanair 740pm wheels up to be exact. i am sending a dm.
@americanair @sarahzou translation: we do not reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'cause we do not care.
@americanair oh my god answer your phone i have been on hold for 1.5 hours. cancelled flighted flights suck
@americanair we are through. i can quit you. i am. the nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
@americanair 719. looks like we are about to get going finally!
@americanair @jimdaytv no you could not care less. that's why their customer service is run by bots
@americanair please tell me how to get a person on the phone as soon as possible
@americanair i have a cancelled flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! please! i just want to go home!
@americanair you wont allow calls? my husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? i cant even call.
@americanair yes but we have to get home tomorrow!!!! please
@americanair unfriendly unhelpful agents. unannounced gate changes. delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
@americanair flight 3056 still sitting at dfw waiting for baggage to be loaded
@americanair i tried several times to select seats. the only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
@americanair we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #fingerscrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
@americanair 3198 to aex. is it still going?
@americanair i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! i have been here since 11 am this morning!
@americanair finally about to take off! thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ ctl. any idea what caused the system failure?
@americanair trying to rebook a flight with you because of cancelled flightlation is a nightmare. i was hung up on once. can you help me rebook?
@americanair i have tried getting help from agents the phone twitter and fb. can no one at american airlines help me?
@americanair close down
@americanair it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to dca. let us get another great leg too tonight!
@americanair i appreciate your apology. sincerely. thank you. that's really all i ever wanted to begin with.
@americanair aa 100 - good job overselling this flight. delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
@americanair i’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
@americanair you know nothing about customer service and i will make sure everyone knows it
@americanair i understand flight cancelled flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hours is not acceptable.
@americanair now i have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which i pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
@americanair your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
@americanair yeah that's not helping. having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
@americanair i did 50 times and no one was helpful i am missing work nd school nd the manager rem from mia told me he did not want to talk us
@americanair my flight to @dfwairport was cancelled flightled. mess ensued. please thank the awesome marcos (concierge key @ gru) for sorting it out!
@americanair i have not been rebooked. i called and left my number for a callback but have not heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
@americanair not enough push crews for jfk = 1.5 he delay and counting....
@americanair i cannot believe how long flight 759 phi is taking. i know it is us airways but you own it. i would really like to get home.
@americanair hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...i love being here for two extra days..
@americanair same as yesterday's cancelled flighted flight. aa104. your customer support is just awful!
@americanair big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here. thanks again for a sleepless night.
@americanair really? not even worthy of a response. this is beginning of a social media alert to the world that aa and @usairways are useles
@americanair hi aa friends! my sis's flight aa362 dfw&gt;&gt;mke was cancelled flighted due to weather. any way you can help here? what are her options?
@americanair is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
@americanair i have not. there's no option for even getting a call back!
@americanair tomorrows flight cancelled flighted. i understand. three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. not cool.
@americanair all flights cancelled flighted tomorrow and that means i am stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
@americanair how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
@americanair why does your iphone app not have any sort of notifications option?
@americanair this is unbelievable and unacceptable. flight #293. jfk. everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
@americanair i made my flight but then still had no update emails when i landed no information ever sent on that or second flight. losing my biz.
@americanair flight 3056 dfw still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
@americanair i still am not on a flight. ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
@americanair my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in dc thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
@americanair if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
@americanair agents refuse to help too busy &amp; need to call advantage#. no one willing to help and apparently being exec plat means zero
@americanair fight got cancelled flighted can you help me rebook a flight? call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
@americanair you should be contacting her for a refund - direct message me and i will provide phone number
@americanair ah if only we could get through. we've tried for over 2 hrs. can we call @united?
@americanair this is ridiculous! you all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. im convinced.
@americanair of course it was not your intention issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins
@americanair i have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
@americanair pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
@americanair trying to check in for flight. on line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
@americanair yep they moved me to 16a as they showed me flying standby
@americanair understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
@americanair my baggage is lost my flight cancelled flightled and i get no accommodations? not even to another airline. at least one free hotel?
@americanair i am on 1024 into dallas. do i have any chance of catching 2238 to boston? do i need to run from gate d6 to a15?.
@americanair aa i need a hail mary. how do i get from dallas to joplin jln in the next 14 hours. willing to fly to other airports and drive
@americanair i have been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. thanks for cancelled flighting my flight and not notifying me.
@americanair rude gate agent by aa363 ord-lga just now. seems to have a temper. made me check in a bag that fit inside the sizer.
@americanair hi ho hi ho. it is off to work i go. #weeklycommuteonaa http://t.co/jqhg4jtm4w
@americanair you put a sour taste on this customer’s vacation. it was joke watching those “we care thanks for choosing us” videos

@americanair help us here !!! we are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus
@americanair lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. i will just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight i want is still there late flightr.
@americanair flight aa1691 los angeles to las closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #patheticcx
@americanair i am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. not really sure what to say...
@americanair here we go again #aa106 plane not ready. are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed
@americanair flight 3056 dfw still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
@americanair at what e-mail adress can i send your Chief Executive Officer mr. doug parker a letter that he hopefully reads?
@americanair why does your customer service line say we are experiencing high call volume and then spontaneously hangup on the person?
@americanair well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up try paying overtime and bring in more people
@americanair what's the best way to check on any delays or cancelled flightlations for my flight out of dfw on tuesday?

@americanair am on web site requesting refund for cancelled flightled flight. it requires numerical document number. where get it?
@americanair hmm. looks like you looked at my tweet from last month not this one. was able to get u.k. agent to help me thanks.
@americanair stuck on a plane at jfk: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. good job aa!
@americanair no one met flight 1081 to los angeles to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #americanairlines
@americanair while i am aggravated - should not baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
“@americanair: @dawn_davis you're very welcome dawn. we love taking you flying. let us do it again!” again in 1 week!
@americanair never fails to disappoint. waiting at jfk an hour after scheduled take off and still no word on departure
@americanair one of my luggage did not made it onto my flight hope it really gets here tomorrow as i was told 😓😭
@americanair lost my wife's luggage and nobody gives you and answer all they say is go here or call there.
@americanair check your direct message please
@americanair why do not you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etcetera. #badmgmt #americanairlines
@americanair the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. i can cancelled flight/change on @southwestair with no penalty or hoops.
@americanair thank you! you will see me :)
@americanair a phone call or email when you cancelled flight a flight would be lovely.

@americanair @seguinej aa - this is a joke right? that line is not even accepting calls right now - they just hang up.
@americanair yes and rebooked incorrectly.
@americanair fair enough. but they could have at least told us. once again it is the lack of communication. delays happen just tell me
@americanair even with calls you have not been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome

@americanair i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. i get she's probably stressed but i am too! an aw let me help cld mk it btr
@americanair while i am sensitive to this fact i do not believe that warrants poor service. a little help &amp; compassion goes a long way.
@americanair flight attendant #yeseniahernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ✈ :-)
@americanair i did. 5 times. with 4 of those being hung up on. the other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #fixyourstuff

@americanair why would i bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing
@americanair five times at last count
@americanair as usual my next flight shows on time but it is suppose to leave in 5 minutes and has not boarded
@americanair 250 i am not sure if i am rebooked now. in a line at airport trying to work it out. the earlier i can get to sfo the better:(

@americanair you cancelled flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!! #not cool #hateful
@americanair no worries they called back 4 hours late flightr while i was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. so by aa standards everything's gr8
@americanair you cant spell airline and i trusted you to get me home on time and safe you are the worst #gobankrupt http://t.co/am9cuiewo4

@americanair dear american when did 2 hour hold times become the industry standard? have you heard of additional staffing during weather?
.@americanair: the best the agent could do is put me on a flight arriving tomorrow afternoon with a six hour layover.
@americanair that's unacceptable. they should allow me to wait on hold or take my number and call me themselves.
@americanair rdu customer service is awesome. thanks! give em all bonuses.
@americanair i let a crew member know every time this happens. which is most of the time.

@americanair i dont believe it it has been impossible for your agents to get an update from the delivery company since yesterday at 11 am
@americanair yet there are plenty of available aa agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
@americanair @bdindallas the personal touch you're known for aa. other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. and 3 hr hold times.
@americanair been waiting in line for over an hour in san antonio barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind.

@americanair please help us get home tomorrow!!!!!
@americanair @tennetexan too bad there's only like 3 people on that team then. because this is next level unreal.
